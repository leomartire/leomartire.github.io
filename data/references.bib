The mechanical coupling between solid planets and their atmospheres enables seismically induced acoustic waves to propagate in the atmosphere. We numerically simulate this coupled system for two application cases: active seismic experiments (ASEs) and passive seismic experiments. A recent ASE (Krishnamoorthy et al., 2018, https://doi.org/10.1002/2018GL077481) observed the infrasonic signals produced by a seismic hammer. To measure the sensitivity of observations to seismic parameters, we attempt to reproduce the results from this experiment at short range by considering a realistic unconsolidated subsurface and an idealized rock-solid subsurface. At long range, we investigate the influence of the source by using two focal mechanisms. We found surface waves generate an infrasonic plane head wave in the ASE case of the rock-solid material. For the passive seismic experiments, the amplitude of atmospheric infrasound generated by seismic surface waves is investigated in detail. Despite some limitations, the simulations suggest that balloon measurement of seismically induced infrasound might help to constrain ground properties.},
