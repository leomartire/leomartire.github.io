abstract = {Recent observations have revealed large F-region electron density perturbations (similar to 100{\%}) and total electron content (TEC) perturbations (similar to 30{\%}) that appear to be correlated with tsunamis. The characteristic speed and horizontal wavelength of the disturbances are similar to 200 m/s and similar to 400 km. We describe numerical simulations using our spectral full-wave model (SFWM) of the upward propagation of a spectrum of gravity waves forced by a tsunami, and the interaction of these waves with the F-region ionosphere. The SFWM describes the propagation of linear, steady-state acoustic-gravity waves in a nonisothermal atmosphere with the inclusion of eddy and molecular diffusion of heat and momentum, ion drag, Coriolis force, and height-dependent mean winds. The tsunami is modeled as a deformation of our model lower boundary traveling at the shallow water wave speed of 200 m/s with a maximum vertical displacement of 50 cm and described by a modified Airy function in the horizontal direction. The derived vertical velocity spectrum at the surface describes the forcing at the lower boundary of the SFWM. A steady-state 1-D ionospheric perturbation model is used to calculate the electron density and TEC perturbations. The molecular diffusion strongly damps the waves in the topside ({\textgreater}300-km altitude) ionosphere. In spite of this, the F-region response is large, with vertical displacements of similar to 2 to 5 km and electron density perturbations of similar to 100{\%}. Mean winds have a profound effect on the ability of the waves to propagate into the F-region ionosphere.},

abstract = {Hydraulic fracturing is widely used in the petroleum industry to enhance oil and gas production, especially for the extraction of shale gas from unconventional reservoirs. A good understanding of the vertical distance which should be preserved between hydraulic stimulation and overlying aquifers (potable water) has been demonstrated as being greater than 600 m (2000 feet). However, the effective application of this technique depends on many factors; one of particular importance is the influence of the fracturing process on pre-existing fractures and faults in the reservoir, which, however, to date, has had little analysis. Specifically, the identification of the required respect distance which must be maintained between the hydraulic fracturing location and pre-existing faults is of paramount importance in minimizing the risk of felt, induced seismicity. This must be an important consideration for setting the guidelines for operational procedures by legislative authorities. We investigate the respect distance using a Monte Carlo approach, generating fifty discrete fracture networks for each of three fracture intensities, on which a hydraulic fracturing simulation is run, using FracMan{\textregistered}. The Coulomb stress change of the rock surrounding the simulated injection stage is calculated for three weighted source mechanisms combining inflation, strike-slip and reverse. The lateral respect distance is obtained using values from literature of the amount of stress required to induce movement on a pre-existing fault. We find that the lateral respect distance is dependent on fracture intensity and the failure threshold. However, the weighting of the source mechanism has limited effect on the lateral respect distance.},

abstract = {Low-frequency sound ≤20 Hz, known as infrasound, is generated by a variety of natural and anthropogenic sources. Following an event, infrasonic waves travel through a dynamic atmosphere that can change on the order of minutes. This makes infrasound event classification a difficult problem, as waveforms from the same source type can look drastically different. Event classification usually requires ground-truth information from seismic or other methods. This is time consuming, inefficient, and does not allow for classification if the event locates somewhere other than a known source, the location accuracy is poor, or ground truth from seismic data is lacking. Here, we compare the performance of the state of the art for infrasound event classification, support vector machine (SVM) to the performance of a convolutional neural network (CNN), a method that has been proven in tangential fields such as seismology. For a 2-class catalog of only volcanic activity and earthquake events, the fourfold average SVM classification accuracy is 75{\%}, whereas it is 74{\%} when using a CNN. Classification accuracies from the 4-class catalog consisting of the most common infrasound events detected at the global scale are 55{\%} and 56{\%} for the SVM and CNN architectures, respectively. These results demonstrate that using a CNN does not increase performance for infrasound event classification. This suggests that SVM should be the preferred classification method, as it is a simpler and more trustworthy architecture and can be tied to the physical properties of the waveforms. The SVM and CNN algorithms described in this article are not yet generalizable to other infrasound event catalogs. We anticipate this study to be a starting point for development of large and comprehensive, systematically labeled, infrasound event catalogs, as such catalogs will be necessary to provide an increase in the value of deep learning on event classification.},

abstract = {Since 1960, several experiments have shown strong perturbations of the ionosphere after earthquakes. For the biggest quakes, Doppler ionospheric soundings have revealed displacements of several tens of meter of the ionized layers E and F. An accurate modelling of these phenomena was however never described. We present here synthetic displacements of such oscillations and compare it with experimental data. Realistic models of the atmosphere including viscosity are used, as well as realistic Earth and seismic source model. These ionospheric oscillations are computed by normal modes summation taking explicitly into account the coupling between the solid Earth and the open atmosphere. They are associated to the Rayleigh fundamental surface waves. We obtain a good agreement between synthetics and observations, so it should be possible to use this method to study the ionospheric postseismic perturbations and possibly the high altitude profile of the density and the viscosity of the atmosphere.},

abstract = {Observations of surface pressure oscillations at the Viking I and Viking 2 lander sites on Mars indicate that the thermally driven global atmospheric tides were closely coupled to the dust content of the Martian atmosphere, especially during northern fall and winter, when two successive global dust storms occurred. The onset of each of these global storms was marked by substantial, nearly simultaneous increases in the dust opacity and in the range of the daily surface pressure variation observed at both lander sites. Although both the diurnal and semidiurnal tidal surface pressure components were amplified at Lander 1 during the onset of a global dust storm, the semidiurnal component was greatly enhanced in relation to the diurnal tide. Semidiurnal wind components were prominent at both lander sites during the height of the global dust storm. We have attempted to interpret these observations using simplified dynamical models. In particular, the semidiurnal wind component can be successfully related to the observed surface pressure variation using a simplified model of a semidiurnally forced Ekman boundary layer. On the other hand, a classical atmospheric tidal model shows that the preferential enhancement of the semidiurnal surface pressure oscillation at Lander I can be produced by a tidal heating distribution which places most of the heating (per unit mass) above 10-km altitude. Furthermore, when a dust storm expands to global scale, it does so rather quickly, and the total atmospheric heating at the peak of the dust storm can represent more than 50{\%} of the available insolation. The Viking observations suggest that a number of mechanisms are important for the generation and decay of these episodic Martian global dust storms.},

abstract = {In a lattice spring model (LSM), the material is discretised into particles linked by springs. However, LSMs always adopt linear springs, which results in a stiff approximation of the corresponding elastic solution. In this work, a high order LSM is proposed to overcome this limitation by introducing additional degrees of freedoms (DOFs) to the particles. Based on the energy minimisation principle and the local strain technique, equations for the stiffness matrices of high order LSM are derived. Relationships between micro spring parameters and macro material constants are derived from the Cauchy-born rules and the hyperelastic theory. Numerical examples show that the high order LSM can provide a better solution than that of the linear LSM and that the LSM is more suitable for modelling singularity and fracture problems. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

@techreport{Kubatko2008,
abstract = {We present a comparative study of two finite element shallow water equation (SWE) models: a generalized wave continuity equation based continuous Galerkin (CG) model—an approach used by several existing SWE models—and a recently developed discontinuous Galerkin (DG) model. While DG methods are known to possess a number of favorable properties, such as local mass conservation, one commonly cited disadvantage is the larger number of degrees of freedom associated with the methods, which naturally translates into a greater computational cost compared to CG methods. However, in a series of numerical tests, we demonstrate that the DG SWE model is generally more efficient than the CG model (i) in terms of achieving a specified error level for a given computational cost and (ii) on large-scale parallel machines due to the inherently local structure of the method. Both models are verified on a series of analytic test cases and validated on a field-scale application. 1. Introduction. The shallow water equations (SWE) are used to model free surface flow in the deep ocean, coastal ocean, estuaries, rivers, open channels, and coastal floodplain. Many flow processes are described by these equations including tides, the propagation of flood waves in rivers, tsunami waves, and storm surges associated with hurricanes. Often coupled with these hydrodynamic phenomena are the transport of quantities such as pollutants, salinity and sediment. The simulation of these types of processes typically requires solving the SWE over large, geometrically complex spatial domains for long periods of time. Such a situation necessitates the use of large-scale computational models that can accurately and efficiently obtain numerical solutions to the SWE. Over the past three decades, various finite element based SWE models have been developed for these purposes; see, for example, [1, 9, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 28, 29]. Finite element methods are a judicious choice as the base algorithm for SWE mod-els due to the flexibility they provide, through the use of unstructured meshes, for accurately resolving a wide range of flow scales and geometrically complex vertical and horizontal boundaries introduced by both the bathymetry/topography and the coastline. Historically, one of the more widespread continuous Galerkin (CG) finite element approaches that has been used for the solution of the SWE involves solving a reformulation of the continuity equation—the so-called " wave continuity equation " . This approach was first proposed by Gray and Lynch [11], extended for the solution of a generalized wave continuity equation (GWCE) by Kinnmark [14], and forms the basis of the advanced circulation (adcirc) model [22] developed by the fourth au-thor and a number of collaborators. While this approach has been successfully used for a number of finite element studies (see, for example, [10, 11, 25, 29, 30, 31]), it is not without its disadvantages. Most notably perhaps, the performance and mass conservation properties of the method are highly dependent on a user-selected GWCE weighting parameter; see, for example, [5, 14, 15, 16]. In part, to address the issues associated with GWCE–based CG models, discon-tinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element models have recently been developed for the},

abstract = {This paper is a short essay on discontinuous Galerkin methods intended for a very wide audience. We present the discon- tinuous Galerkin methods and describe and discuss their main features. Since the methods use completely discontinuous approximations, they produce mass matrices that are block-diagonal. This renders the methods highly parallelizable when applied to hyperbolic problems. Another consequence of the use of discontinuous approximations is that these methods can easily handle irregular meshes with hanging nodes and approximations that have polynomials of different degrees in different elements. They are thus ideal for use with adaptive algorithms. Moreover, the methods are locally conservative (a property highly valued by the computational fluid dynamics community) and, in spite of providing discontinuous approximations, stable, and high-order accurate. Even more, when applied to non-linear hyperbolic problems, the discontinuous Galerkin methods are able to capture highly complex solutions presenting discontinuities with high resolution. In this paper, we con- centrate on the exposition of the ideas behind the devising of these methods as well as on the mechanisms that allow them to perform so well in such a variety of problems.},

abstract = {A method of construction of solution for acoustic-gravity waves (AGW) above a wave source, taking dissipation throughout the atmosphere into account (dissipative solution above source, DSAS), is proposed. The method is to combine three solutions for three parts of the atmosphere: an analytical solution for the upper isothermal part and numerical solutions for the real non-isothermal dissipative atmosphere in the middle part and for the real non-isothermal small dissipation atmosphere in the lower one. In this paper the method has been carried out for the atmosphere with thermal conductivity but without viscosity. The heights of strong dissipation and the total absorption index in the regions of weak and average dissipation are found. For internal gravity waves the results of test calculations for an isothermal atmosphere and calculations for a real non-isothermal atmosphere are shown in graphical form. An algorithm and appropriate code to calculate DSAS, taking dissipation due to finite thermal conductivity into account throughout the atmosphere, are developed. The results of test DSAS calculations for an everywhere isothermal atmosphere are given. The calculation results for DSAS for the real non-isothermal atmosphere are also presented. A method for construction of the 2×2 Green's matrix fully taking dissipation into account and allowing us to find disturbance from some source of AGW in the atmosphere is proposed.},

abstract = {Key Points: • Volcanic infrasound sources are useful for NWP validation studies • The largest discrepancies are found during equinox periods and the boreal winter • Infrasound-derived updates are in line with lidar and wind radiometer statistics Abstract In this paper, we evaluate vertical wind and temperature profiles that are produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) atmospheric analysis. The evaluation is carried out on both hemispheres: we make use of stratospheric infrasound arrivals from Mount Etna (37 • N) and Mount Yasur (22 • S). The near-continuous, high activity of both volcanoes permits the study of stratospheric propagation along well-defined paths with a time resolution ranging from hours to multiple years. Infrasound observables are compared to theoretical estimates obtained from acoustic propagation modeling using the ECMWF analysis. While a first-order agreement is found for both hemispheres, we report on significant discrepancies around some of the equinox periods and other intervals during which the atmosphere is in a state of transition and dynamical oscillations of the atmosphere dominate over the general circulation. We present an inversion study in which we make use of measured trace velocity estimates to estimate first-order effective sound speed model updates in a Bayesian framework. Deviations from the a priori models around the stratopause up to 10{\%} (≈ 30 m s −1) are estimated. Such updates are in line with the results from comparisons between ECMWF analysis and observations from lidar and microwave Doppler spectroradiometer facilities that were colocated during the course of the 2012–2013 Atmospheric dynamics Research and InfraStructure in Europe (ARISE) measurement campaign.},

@article{Bodony2006,
abstract = {The use of sponge regions, or sponge zones, which add the forcing term -$\sigma$(q - qref) to the right-hand-side of the governing equations in computational fluid mechanics as an ad hoc boundary treatment is widespread. They are used to absorb and minimize reflections from computational boundaries and as forcing sponges to introduce prescribed disturbances into a calculation. A less common usage is as a means of extending a calculation from a smaller domain into a larger one, such as in computing the far-field sound generated in a localized region. By analogy to the penalty method of finite elements, the method is placed on a solid foundation, complete with estimates of convergence. The analysis generalizes the work of Israeli and Orszag [M. Israeli, S.A. Orszag, Approximation of radiation boundary conditions, J. Comp. Phys. 41 (1981) 115-135] and confirms their findings when applied as a special case to one-dimensional wave propagation in an absorbing sponge. It is found that the rate of convergence of the actual solution to the target solution, with an appropriate norm, is inversely proportional to the sponge strength. A detailed analysis for acoustic wave propagation in one-dimension verifies the convergence rate given by the general theory. The exponential point-wise convergence derived by Israeli and Orszag in the high-frequency limit is recovered and found to hold over all frequencies. A weakly nonlinear analysis of the method when applied to Burgers' equation shows similar convergence properties. Three numerical examples are given to confirm the analysis: the acoustic extension of a two-dimensional time-harmonic point source, the acoustic extension of a three-dimensional initial-value problem of a sound pulse, and the introduction of unstable eigenmodes from linear stability theory into a two-dimensional shear layer. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

@phdthesis{Mengaldo2015,
abstract = {This thesis is concerned with the development and analysis of discontinuous spec- tral/hp element methods and their applications to compressible aerodynamics with special focus on boundary-layer flows. In this thesis, we provide a de- tailed analysis on the connections between the discontinuous Galerkin method and the flux reconstruction approach for multidimensional nonlinear systems of conservation laws on irregular meshes (i.e. meshes with deformed and/or curved elements). The results help a better understanding of the broader class of discon- tinuous spectral/hp element methods and allow the direct applications to the flux reconstruction approach of the existing and more established techniques used in the discontinuous Galerkin community for tackling various issues of this class of schemes, including their aliasing problems. From this perspective, we present two dealiasing strategies based on the concept of consistent integration of the nonlinear terms (also referred to as over-integration of the linear terms). The first is a localised approach and it targets in each element the nonlinearities arising in the problem, while the second is a more global approach which involves a higher quadrature of the overall right-hand side of the discretised equation(s). The two dealiasing strategies have been observed to be effective in enhancing the numerical stability of both schemes, the flux reconstruction and the discontinuous Galerkin approaches. We finally present the direct numerical simulation of a high-speed subsonic flow past a roughness element, achieved by means of the discontinuous spectral/hp element methods developed. These results were successively compared to some data obtained from the asymptotic triple-deck theory. This work, besides demon- strating that the class of schemes analysed and developed is attractive for such aerodynamic problems, also addresses the lack of comparisons between theoretical models and numerical simulations.},

In particular, we provide values of the highest confidence possible for atmospheric opacity, atmospheric pressure, near-surface air temperature, ground temperature, near-surface wind speed and direction, and near-surface air relative humidity and water vapor content. Then, we study the diurnal, seasonal and interannual variability of these quantities over a span of more than twenty Martian years. Finally, we propose measurements to improve our understanding of the Martian dust and H2O cycles, and discuss the potential for liquid water formation under Mars' present day conditions and its implications for future Mars missions.

These arrivals have propagation speeds c (c = r/T, r is the distance between source and receiver, and T is the propagation time) higher than 320 m/s and are observed in the absence of acoustic waveguides in the atmospheric boundary layer (in the presence of wind and temperature inversions) and in the troposphere (in the presence of jet streams). It is assumed that such signals correspond to infrasonic propagation along a slightly inclined ray path having a significantly extended horizontal portion at a height of the maximum effective sound speed within the upper stratosphere (z is about 50 km). Ray theory and the pseudodifferential parabolic equation method are used as theoretical models. The solutions obtained are compared with experimental data on acoustic signals recorded at a distance of 635 km from surface explosions (equivalent to about 500 t of TNT) set off two years apart.

abstract = {Our new 1-by-1 degree global crustal model, CRUST1.0, was introduced last year and serves as starting model in a comprehensive effort to compile a global model of Earth's crust and lithosphere, LITHO1.0 (Pasyanos et al., 2012). The Moho depth in CRUST1.0 is based on 1-degree averages of a recently updated database of crustal thickness data from active source seismic studies as well as from receiver function studies. In areas where such constraints are still missing, for example in Antarctica, crustal thicknesses are estimated using gravity constraints. The compilation of the new crustal model initially followed the philosophy of the widely used crustal model CRUST2.0 (Bassin et al., 2000; http://igppweb.ucsd.edu/{\~{}}gabi/crust2.html) to assign elastic properties in the crystalline crust according to basement age or tectonic setting (loosely following an updated map by Artemieva and Mooney (2001; http://www.lithosphere.info). For cells with no local seismic or gravity constraints, statistical averages of crustal properties, including crustal thickness, were extrapolated. However, in places with constraints the depth to basement and mantle are given explicitly and no longer assigned by crustal type. This allows for much smaller errors in both. In each 1-degree cell, boundary depth, compressional and shear velocity as well as density is given for 8 layers: water, ice, 3 sediment layers and upper, middle and lower crystalline crust. Topography, bathymetry and ice cover are taken from ETOPO1. The sediment cover is based on our sediment model (Laske and Masters, 1997; http://igppweb.ucsd.edu/{\~{}}sediment.html), with some near-coastal updates. In an initial step toward LITHO1.0, the model is then validated against new global surface wave disperison maps and adjusted in areas of extreme misfit. This poster presents the next validation step: compare the new Moho depths with in-situ active source and receiver function results. We also present comparisons with CRUST2.0. CRUST1.0 is available for download.

abstract = {Three large-scale infrasound calibration experiments were conducted in 2009 and 2011 to test the International Monitoring System (IMS) infrasound network and provide ground truth data for infrasound propagation studies. Here we provide an overview of the deployment, detonation, atmospheric specifications, infrasound array observations, and propagation modeling for the experiments. The experiments at the Sayarim Military Range, Israel, had equivalent TNT yields of 96.0, 7.4, and 76.8 t of explosives on 26 August 2009, 24 January 2011, and 26 January 2011, respectively. Successful international collaboration resulted in the deployment of numerous portable infrasound arrays in the region to supplement the IMS network and increase station density. Infrasound from the detonations is detected out to {\~{}}3500 km to the northwest in 2009 and {\~{}}6300 km to the northeast in 2011, reflecting the highly anisotropic nature of long-range infrasound propagation. For 2009, the moderately strong stratospheric wind jet results in a well-predicted set of arrivals at numerous arrays to the west-northwest. A second set of arrivals is also apparent, with low celerities and high frequencies. These arrivals are not predicted by the propagation modeling and result from unresolved atmospheric features. Strong eastward tropospheric winds (up to {\~{}}70 m/s) in 2011 produce high-amplitude tropospheric arrivals recorded out to {\textgreater}1000 km to the east. Significant eastward stratospheric winds (up to {\~{}}80 m/s) in 2011 generate numerous stratospheric arrivals and permit the long-range detection (i.e., {\textgreater}1000 km). No detections are made in directions opposite the tropospheric and stratospheric wind jets for any of the explosions. Comparison of predicted transmission loss and observed infrasound arrivals gives qualitative agreement. Propagation modeling for the 2011 experiments predicts lower transmission loss in the direction of the downwind propagation compared to the 2009 experiment, consistent with the greater detection distance. Observations also suggest a more northerly component to the stratospheric winds for the 2009 experiment and less upper atmosphere attenuation. The Sayarim infrasound calibration experiments clearly demonstrate the complexity and variability of the atmosphere, and underscore the utility of large-scale calibration experiments with dense networks for better understanding infrasound propagation and detection. Additionally, they provide a rich data set for future scientific research. Key Points Three large ground-truth infrasound experiments were conducted in 2009 and 2011 Strong wind jets permitted long range detection Atmospheric specifications sufficient for qualitative propagation modeling {\textcopyright} 2013.

abstract = {The Pyrenean mountain range is a slowly deforming belt with continuous and moderate seismic activity. To quantify its deformation field, we present the velocity field estimated from a GPS survey of the Pyrenees spanning 18 yr. The PotSis and ResPyr networks, including a total of 85 GPS sites, were installed and first measured in 1992 and 1995-1997, respectively, and remeasured in 2008 and 2010.We obtain a deformation field with velocities less than 1mmyr-1 across the range. The estimated velocities for individual stations do not differ significantly from zero with 95 per cent confidence. Even so, we estimate a maximum extensional horizontal strain rate of 2.0 ± 1.7 nanostrain per year in a N-S direction in the western part of the range. We do not interpret the vertical displacements due to their large uncertainties. In order to compare the horizontal strain rates with the seismic activity, we analyse a set of 194 focal mechanisms using three methods: (i) the 'r' factor relating their P and T axes, (ii) the stress tensors obtained by fault slip inversion and (iii) the strain-rate tensors. Stress and strain-rate tensors are estimated for: (i) the whole data set, (ii) the eastern and western parts of the range separately, and (iii) eight zones, which are defined based on the seismicity and the tectonic patterns of the Pyrenees. Each of these analyses reveals a lateral variation of the deformation style from compression and extension in the east to extension and strike-slip in the west of the range. Although the horizontal components of the strain-rate tensors estimated from the seismic data are slightly smaller in magnitude than those computed from the GPS velocity field, they are consistent within the 2$\sigma$ uncertainties. Furthermore, the orientations of their principal axes agree with the mapped active faults.},

abstract = {The inclusion of transverse effects in designing characteristic boundary conditions for the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations was discussed by different authors and has proved to give some improvement in the perspective of reducing numerical perturbations generated at open boundaries. Based on the most general characteristic formulation using nonorthogonal and rotated reference frames, ananalysis of the different terms involved in such an approach is carried out in the present work. To achieve the best performance for the numerical behavior of the boundary condition, it is then shown that different transverse terms need to be treated differently when included in the definition of the incoming wave amplitude variations. The analysis is supported by a series of numerical tests involving aninviscid vortex convected atanangle or a purely acoustic wave propagating radially. It is concluded that the optimal behavior in terms of acoustic reflection by outgoing vorticity can be achieved by minimizing the contribution of the transverse terms related to the material derivatives along the bicharacteristics, either by properly relaxing them or by selecting a characteristic direction which is not necessarily orthogonal to the boundary.

abstract = {We present an efficient discontinuous Galerkin scheme for simulation of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations including laminar and turbulent flow. We consider a semi-explicit high-order velocity-correction method for time integration as well as nodal equal-order discretizations for velocity and pressure. The non-linear convective term is treated explicitly while a linear system is solved for the pressure Poisson equation and the viscous term. The key feature of our solver is a consistent penalty term reducing the local divergence error in order to overcome recently reported instabilities in spatially under-resolved high-Reynolds-number flows as well as small time steps. This penalty method is similar to the grad–div stabilization widely used in continuous finite elements. We further review and compare our method to several other techniques recently proposed in literature to stabilize the method for such flow configurations. The solver is specifically designed for large-scale computations through matrix-free linear solvers including efficient preconditioning strategies and tensor-product elements, which have allowed us to scale this code up to 34.4 billion degrees of freedom and 147,456 CPU cores. We validate our code and demonstrate optimal convergence rates with laminar flows present in a vortex problem and flow past a cylinder and show applicability of our solver to direct numerical simulation as well as implicit large-eddy simulation of turbulent channel flow at Re$\tau$=180 as well as 590.},

abstract = {The new NRLMSISE-00 empirical atmospheric model extends from the ground to the exobase and is a major upgrade of the MSISE-90 model in the thermosphere. The new model and the associated NRLMSIS database now include the following data: (1) total mass density from satellite accelerometers and from orbit determination (including the Jacchia and Barlier data sets), (2) temperature from incoherent scatter radar covering 1981–1997, and (3) molecular oxygen number density, [O2], from solar ultraviolet occultation aboard the Solar Maximum Mission. A new component, ‘‘anomalous oxygen,'' allows for appreciable O+ and hot atomic oxygen contributions to the total mass density at high altitudes and applies primarily to drag estimation above 500 km. Extensive tables compare our entire database to the NRLMSISE-00, MSISE-90, and Jacchia-70 models for different altitude bands and levels of geomagnetic activity. We also explore scientific issues related to the new data sets in the NRLMSIS database. Especially noteworthy is the solar activity dependence of the Jacchia data, with which we study a large O+ contribution to the total mass density under the combination of summer, low solar activity, high latitude, and high altitude. Under these conditions, except at very low solar activity, the Jacchia data and the Jacchia-70 model indeed show a significantly higher total mass density than does MSISE-90. However, under the corresponding winter conditions, the MSIS-class models represent a noticeable improvement relative to Jacchia- 70 over a wide range of F10.7. Considering the two regimes together, NRLMSISE-00 achieves an improvement over both MSISE-90 and Jacchia-70 by incorporating advantages of each.},

@article{Kanamori1977,
abstract = {The conventional magnitude scale M suffers saturation when the rupture dimension of the earthquake exceeds the wavelength of the seismic waves used for the magnitude determination (usually 5-50 km). This saturation leads to an inaccurate estimate of energy released in great earthquakes. To circumvent this problem the strain energy drop Wdifference in strain energy before and after an earthquake) in great earthquakes is estimated from the seismic moment Mo. If the stress drop Ds is complete, W = W0 = (Ds/2m)M0 {\~{}} M0/(2x104), where m is the rigidity; if it is partial, Wo gives the minimum estimate of the strain energy drop. Furthermore, if Orowan's condition, i.e., that frictional stress equal final stress, is met, W0 represents the seismic wave energy. A new magnitude scale Mw is defined in terms of IVO through the standard energy-magnitude relation log W0 = 1.5Mw + 11.8. Mw is as large as 9.5 for the 1960 Chilean earthquake and connects smoothly to M, (surface wave magnitude) for earthquakes with a rupture dimension of about 100 km or less. The Mu. scale does not suffer saturation and is a more adequate magnitude scale for great earthquakes. The seismic energy release curve defined by W, is entirely different from that previously estimated from M,. During the 15-year period from 1950 to 1965 the annual average of Wa is more than I order of magnitude larger than that during the periods from 1920 to 1950 and from 1965 to 1976. The temporal variation of the amplitude of the Chandler wobble correlates very well with the variation of W0, with a slight indication of the former preceding the latter. In contrast, the number N of moderate to large earthquakes increased very sharply as the Chandler wobble amplitude increased but decreased very sharply during the period from 1945 to 1965, when IVO was largest. One possible explanation for these correlations is that the increase in the wobble amplitude triggers worldwide seismic activity and accelerates plate motion which eventually leads to great decoupling earthquakes. This decoupling causes the decline of moderate to large earthquake activity. Changes in the rotation rate of the earth may be an important element in this mechanism.},

The effects of winds on the propagation are assessed by examining computations carried out for various fixed directions of the horizontal group velocity and from the computation of deviations of the phase-velocity direction from group-velocity direction for the case of propagation crosswind. Pressure height profiles of various frequencies propagating in various modes are exhibited and excitation amplitudes for ground level sources (excluding the frequency spectrum of the source) are plotted versus frequency for various modes and various group-velocity directions. Qualitative explanations of the computed results are given, and the implications of the results to actual waveforms are discussed.},

Theoretical results suggest that the nature of plane waves in anelastic materials is distinctly different from the nature of plane waves in elastic materials. In elastic media the only type of inhomogeneous plane wave (P or S) that can propagate is one for which planes of constant phase are perpendicular to planes of constant amplitude. However, in anelastic media this is the only type of inhomogeneous wave that cannot propagate. For an inhomogeneous P or S plane wave the particle motion is elliptical, the velocity is less than that of a corresponding homogeneous wave, the maximum attenuation is greater than that of a corresponding homogeneous wave, and the direction of maximum energy flow is not the direction of phase propagation. Expressions for the energy flux, energy densities, dissipated energy, stored energy, and Q−1 are derived from an explicit energy conservation relation, valid for an arbitrary steady state viscoelastic radiation field. Each energy expression is valid for homogeneous or inhomogeneous P or S plane waves in elastic or linear anelastic media.},

abstract = {Acoustic and gravity waves propagating in planetary atmospheres have been studied intensively as markers of specific phenomena such as tectonic events or explosions or as contributors to atmosphere dynamics. To get a better understanding of the physics behind these dynamic processes, both acoustic and gravity waves propagation should be modelled in a 3D attenuating and windy atmosphere extending from the ground to the upper thermosphere. Thus, in order to provide an efficient numerical tool at the regional or global scale we introduce a finite difference in the time domain (FDTD) approach that relies on the linearized compressible Navier-Stokes equations with a back- ground flow (wind). One significant benefit of such a method is its versatility because it handles both acoustic and gravity waves in the same simulation, which enables one to observe interactions between them. Simulations can be performed for 2D or 3D realistic cases such as tsunamis in a full MSISE-00 atmosphere or gravity-wave generation by atmospheric explosions. We validate the computations by comparing them to analyti- cal solutions based on dispersion relations in specific benchmark cases: an atmospheric explosion, and a ground displacement forcing.},

abstract = {Oceanic pressure measurements, even in very deep water, and atmospheric pressure or seismic records, from anywhere on Earth, contain noise with dominant periods between 3 and 10 s, which is believed to be excited by ocean surface gravity waves. Most of this noise is explained by a nonlinear wave–wave interaction mechanism, and takes the form of surface gravity waves, acoustic or seismic waves. Previous theoretical work on seismic noise focused on surface (Rayleigh) waves, and did not consider finite-depth effects on the generating wave kinematics. These finite-depth effects are introduced here, which requires the consideration of the direct wave-induced pressure at the ocean bottom, a contribution previously overlooked in the context of seismic noise. That contribution can lead to a considerable reduction of the seismic noise source, which is particularly relevant for noise periods larger than 10 s. The theory is applied to acoustic waves in the atmosphere, extending previous theories that were limited to vertical propagation only. Finally, the noise generation theory is also extended beyond the domain of Rayleigh waves, giving the first quantitative expression for sources of seismic body waves. In the limit of slow phase speeds in the ocean wave forcing, the known and well- verified gravity wave result is obtained, which was previously derived for an incompressible ocean. The noise source of acoustic, acoustic-gravity and seismic modes are given by a mode-specific amplification of the same wave-induced pressure field near zero wavenumber.},

abstract = {The largest tsunamis are generated by seafloor uplift resulting from rupture of offshore subduction-zone megathrusts. The rupture of the shallowest part of a megathrust often produces unexpected outsize tsunami relative to their seismic magnitude. These are so called ‘tsunami earthquakes', which are difficult to identify rapidly using the current tsunami warning systems, even though, they produce some of the deadliest tsunami. We here introduce a new method to evaluate the tsunami risk by measuring ionospheric total electron content (TEC). We examine two Mw 7.8 earthquakes (one is a tsunami earthquake and the other is not) generated in 2010 by the Sunda megathrust, offshore Sumatra, to demonstrate for the first time that observations of ionospheric sounding from Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) can be used to evaluate the tsunamigenic potential of earthquakes as early as 8 min after the mainshock.},

abstract = {No two rocky bodies offer a better laboratory for exploring the conditions controlling interior dynamics than Venus and Earth. Their similarities in size, density, distance from the sun, and young surfaces would suggest comparable interior dynamics. Although the two planets exhibit some of the same processes, Venus lacks Earth's dominant process for losing heat and cycling volatiles between the interior and the surface and atmosphere: plate tectonics. One commonality is the size and number of mantle plume features which are inferred to be active today and arise at the core mantle boundary. Such mantle plumes require heat loss from the core, yet Venus lacks a measurable interior dynamo. There is evidence for plume-induced subduction on Venus, but no apparent mosaic of moving plates. Absent plate tectonics, one essential question for interior dynamics is how did Venus obtain its young resurfacing age? Via catastrophic or equilibrium processes? Related questions are how does it lose heat via past periods of plate tectonics, has it always had a stagnant lid, or might it have an entirely different mode of heat loss? Although there has been no mission dedicated to surface and interior processes since the Magellan mission in 1990, near infrared surface emissivity data that provides information on the iron content of the surface mineralogy was obtained fortuitously from Venus Express. These data imply both the presence of continental-like crust, and thus formation in the presence of water, and recent volcanism at mantle hotspots. In addition, the study of interior dynamics for both Earth and exoplanets has led to new insights on the conditions required to initiate subduction and develop plate tectonics, including the possible role of high temperature lithosphere, and a renewed drive to reveal why Venus and Earth differ. Here we review current data that constrains the interior dynamics of Venus, new insights into its interior dynamics, and the data needed to resolve key questions.},

We calculate the "breathing mode" oscillations for this system and find good agreement with analytical solutions. Furthermore, we simulate the impact of the fluid-filled, elastic shell on a hard wall and on an adhesive surface. Understanding the dynamics of fluid-filled shells, especially near adhesive surfaces, can be particularly important in the design of microcapsules for pharmaceutical and other technological applications. Our studies reveal that the binding of these capsules to specific surfaces can be sensitive to the physical properties of both the outer shell and the enclosed fluid. The integrated LBM-LSM methodology opens up the possibility of accurately and efficiently capturing the dynamic coupling between fluid flow and a compliant bounding surface in a broad variety of systems. {\textcopyright} 2005 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The coda quality factor of short-period S waves (Qc) excited by local earthquakes in the Pyrenees has been measured as a function of the length of the coda window (LW) for different choices of the onset time of the coda (tW). In the 2-16 Hz frequency band, we observe a transient regime characterized by an increase of Qc with LW, followed by a stabilization around a plateau the value of which depends on the central frequency of the signal. Using Monte Carlo simulations of wave transport in a variety of random media (≈1200 models), we demonstrate that the lapsetime dependence of Qc in the Pyrenees may be modeled by multiple anisotropic scattering of seismic waves, without invoking any depth dependence of the attenuation properties in the crust. In our model, anisotropic scattering is quantified by the ratio between the transport mean free path and the mean path (l*=l). At 6 Hz, the data require an anisotropy factor l*=l ≥ 5, a transport mean free path l ≈ 400 km, and an intrinsic quality factor Qi ≈ 800. From the frequency-dependent plateau of Qc at large lapse time, we infer an intrinsic quality factor of the form Qi ≈ 400f0:4 in the Pyrenees. We also show how the rapid increase of the lapse-time dependence of Qc with frequency may be exploited to put constraints on the power spectrum of heterogeneities in the crust.},

abstract = {Procedures to define boundary conditions for Navier-Stokes equations are discussed. A new formulation using characteristic wave relations through boundaries is derived for the Euler equations and generalized to the Navier-Stokes equations. The emphasis is on deriving boundary conditions compatible with modern non-dissipative algorithms used for direct simulations of turbulent flows. These methods have very low dispersion errors and require precise boundary conditions to avoid numerical instabilities and to control spurious wave reflections at the computational boundaries. The present formulation is an attempt to provide such conditions. Reflecting and non-reflecting boundary condition treatments are presented. Examples of practical implementations for inlet and outlet boundaries as well as slip and no-slip walls are presented. The method applies to subsonic and supersonic flows. It is compared with a reference method based on extrapolation and partial use of Riemann invariants. Test cases described include a ducted shear layer, vortices propagating through boundaries, and Poiseuille flow. Although no mathematical proof of well-posedness is given, the method uses the correct number of boundary conditions required for well-posedness of the Navier-Stokes equations and the examples reveal that it provides a significant improvement over the reference method. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {The underground nuclear tests by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) generated atmospheric infrasound both in 2013 and 2016. Clear detections were made in the Russian Federation (I45RU) and Japan (I30JP) in 2013 at stations from the International Monitoring System. Both tropospheric and stratospheric refractions arrived at the stations. In 2016, only a weak return was potentially observed at I45RU. Data analysis and propagation modeling show that the noise level at the stations and the stratospheric circumpolar vortex were different in 2016 compared to 2013. As the seismic magnitude of the 2013 and 2016 nuclear test explosions was comparable, we hypothesize that the 2016 test occurred at least 1.5 times deeper. In such a case, less seismic energy would couple through the lithosphere-atmosphere interface, leading to less observable infrasound. Since explosion depth is difficult to estimate from seismic data alone, this motivates a synergy between seismics and infrasonics.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the interior structure of Mars is of fundamental importance to the understanding of its past and present state as well as its future evolution. The most prominent interior structure properties are the state of the core, solid or liquid, its radius, and its composition in terms of light elements, the thickness of the mantle, its composition, the presence of a lower mantle, and the density of the crust. In the absence of seismic sounding only geodesy data allow reliably constraining the deep interior of Mars. Those data are the mass, moment of inertia, and tides. They are related to Mars' composition, to its internal mass distribution, and to its deformational response to principally the tidal forcing of the Sun. Here we use the most recent estimates of the moment of inertia and tidal Love number k2 in order to infer knowledge about the interior structure of the Mars. We have built precise models of the interior structure of Mars that are parameterized by the crust density and thickness, the volume fractions of upper mantle mineral phases, the bulk mantle iron concentration, and the size and the sulfur concentration of the core. From the bulk mantle iron concentration and from the volume fractions of the upper mantle mineral phases, the depth dependent mineralogy is deduced by using experimentally determined phase diagrams. The thermoelastic properties at each depth inside the mantle are calculated by using equations of state. Since it is difficult to determine the temperature inside the mantle of Mars we here use two end-member temperature profiles that have been deduced from studies dedicated to the thermal evolution of Mars. We calculate the pressure and temperature dependent thermoelastic properties of the core constituents by using equations state and recent data about reference thermoelastic properties of liquid iron, liquid iron-sulfur, and solid iron. To determine the size of a possible inner core we use recent data on the melting temperature of iron-sulfur. Within our model assumptions the geodesy data imply that Mars has no solid inner core and that the liquid core contains a large fraction of sulfur. The absence of a solid inner is in agreement with the absence of a global magnetic field. We estimate the radius of the core to be 1794 ± 65. km and its core sulfur concentration to be 16 ± 2. wt{\%}. We also show that it is possible for Mars to have a thin layer of perovskite at the bottom of the mantle if it has a hot mantle temperature. Moreover a chondritic Fe/Si ratio is shown to be consistent with the geodesy data, although significantly different value are also possible. Our results demonstrate that geodesy data alone, even if a mantle temperature is assumed, can almost not constrain the mineralogy of the mantle and the crust. In order to obtain stronger constraints on the mantle mineralogy bulk properties, like a fixed Fe/Si ratio, have to be assumed. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {A preliminary analysis of a global survey of Magellan data covering over 90{\%} of the surface and designed to document the characteristics, location, and dimensions of all major volcanic features on Venus has revealed over 1660 landforms and deposits including shield fields, calderalike structures, coronae, arachnoids, novae, lava flood-type flow fields, and sinuous lava channels. The vast majority of landforms are consistent with basaltic compositions. The range of morphologies indicates that a spectrum of intrusive and extrusive processes have operated on Venus. The large size of many volcanic features is evidence for the presence of very large magma reservoirs. The areal distribution, abundance, and size distribution relationships of shield fields, arachnoids, novae, large volcanoes, and coronae strongly suggest that they are the surface manifestation of mantle plumes or hot spots and that the different morphologies represent variations in plume size and stage and thermal structure of the lithosphere. Maps of the global distribution of volcanic features show that they are broadly distributed globally, in contrast to the plate boundary concentrations typical of Earth. However, they are not randomly distributed on the surface of Venus. -from Authors},

abstract = {Planetary atmospheres are complex dynamical systems whose structure, composition, and dynamics intimately affect the propagation of sound. Thus, acoustic waves, being coupled directly to the medium, can effectively probe planetary environments. Here we show how the acoustic absorption and speed of sound in the atmospheres of Venus, Mars, Titan, and Earth (as predicted by a recent molecular acoustics model) mirror the different environments. Starting at the surface, where the sound speed ranges from ∼200 m/s for Titan to ∼410 m/s for Venus, the vertical sound speed profiles reveal differences in the atmospheres' thermal layering and composition. The absorption profiles are relatively smooth for Mars, Titan, and Earth while Venus stands out with a noticeable attenuation dip occurring between 40 and 100 km. We also simulate a descent module sampling the sound field produced by a low-frequency "event" near the surface noting the occurrence of acoustic quiet zones. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Studying the atmospheric Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) is crucial to understand the climate of a planet. The meteorological measurements by the instruments onboard InSight make a uniquely rich dataset to study the active turbulent dynamics of the daytime PBL on Mars. Here we use the high-sensitivity continuous pressure, wind, temperature measurements in the first 400 sols of InSight operations to analyze convective gusts, cells, and vortices in Mars' daytime PBL. We compare the InSight measurements to turbulence-resolving Large-Eddy Simulations (LES). The daytime PBL turbulence at the InSight landing site is found to be very active, with clearly identified signatures of convective cells and a vast population of almost 10,000 recorded vortex encounters, adequately represented by a power-law with a 3.5 exponent in agreement with LES results. While the daily variability of vortex encounters at the InSight landing site can be explained by the statistical nature of turbulence, the seasonal variability is strongly correlated with ambient wind speed, which is supported by LES. However, wind gustiness is more correlated to surface temperature than ambient wind speed, confirming the radiative control of the daytime martian PBL; and fewer convective vortices are forming in LES when the background wind is doubled. Thus, the long-term seasonal variability of vortex encounters at the InSight landing site is mainly controlled by the advection of convective vortices by the ambient wind speed. Typical tracks followed by vortices forming in the LES show a similar distribution in direction and length as orbital imagery of the InSight region.},

abstract = {Volcanoes generate a wide variety of low-frequency (∼0.01-20 Hz) acoustic signals, and infrasound technology is part of an expanding suite of geo-physical tools available to characterize, understand, and monitor volcanic processes. We review recent advances in the field of volcano acoustics with an emphasis on scientific and potential civil application gains from the International Monitoring System (IMS) infrasound network. Energetic infrasound from explosive volcanism can propagate hundreds to thousands of kilometers in atmospheric waveguides and large explosive eruptions (which represent significant societal and economic hazards) are routinely recorded by the IMS infrasound network. Significant progress in understanding volcano infrasound has been made through dedicated local deployments (within {\textless}15 km of the source) in tandem with other observation systems. This research has identified diverse source mechanisms of volcanically generated infrasound, and elucidated the influence of near-source topography and local atmospheric conditions on acoustic propagation and recordings. Similarly, advances are being achieved in inferring volcanic source processes from signals recorded at the longer ranges typically associated with IMS detections. However, practical challenges remain in the optimization of remote volcano infrasound signal detection, discrimination, association, and location. Many of these challenges are the result of strong signal variability associated with long-range R. Matoza (✉)},

Comparison of the spectra of the acoustic waves at two heights indicates that the shorter-period oscillations (about 20-25 seconds) were more severely attenuated with height than the longer-period oscillations (about 2 minutes).

A ray theoretical approach appears robust and efficient. It furthermore allows a straightforward interpretation of recorded phases. We have developed a three-dimensional Hamiltonian ray tracing for modeling linear acoustic waves in the atmosphere. Propagating over distances superior to 500 km requires the curvature of the Earth to be considered, which is achieved by using spherical coordinates. High atmospheric winds are properly handled through a modified Hamiltonian. These winds as well as sound velocity can change significantly during long-lasting propagations; these variations are also included in our modeling. Finally, the amplitude of infrasonic signals is computed by concomitantly solving for paraxial rays and assessing the evolution of the ray tube thus defined. We present the theory for this atmospheric infrasound modeling and some simple applications that establish its robustness and potential.},

abstract = {Nowadays, the lattice Boltzmann method has been widely used by scientists and engineers as an alternative to conventional numerical solvers for the Navier-Stokes equations. The present work in this thesis aims at studying the lattice Boltzmann method for fluid dynamics from the kinetic point of view in contrast to macroscopic differential systems. And the main topics are concentrated on three aspects: theoretical back- ground of lattice Boltzmann method, boundary conditions as well as multiblock and multigrid methods. In the first part, the conceptual framework from statistical mechanics to fluid dynamics and the theoretical foundation for the lattice Boltzmann method are constructed. Both Grad's representation approach and Chapman-Enskog expansion approach are employed to derive the Navier-Stokes equations in fluid dynamics from Boltzmann-BGK equation. Different lattice structure in 1D, 2D and 3D are deduced from Gauss-Hermite quadrature. The general algorithm for lattice Boltzmann method as well as how to deal with compressibility effects and physical, dimensionless and lattice Boltzmann systems are summarized. The second part is devoted to investigating different methods for imposing boundary conditions, in particular Dirichlet boundary conditions, on both straight and curved boundaries for lattice Boltzmann method. The difficulties of imposing macroscopic boundary conditions on kinetic distribution functions accurately and stably are ad- dressed for straight and curved boundaries respectively, and two families of techniques under the name of “Distribution Modification” and “Distribution Reconstruction” are reviewed and presented with respect to these difficulties. In order to push the lattice Boltzmann method to more practical applications, where multiscale physical problem in complex geometry and large scale parallel computation come on the stage, the use ofmultiblock andmultigrid techniques is mandatory. Several multiblock and multigrid methods are examined and extended in the last part. Some basic ideas, such as overlapping and conservation laws, are borrowed from the field of domain decomposition and developed specifically for lattice Boltzmann method. Poiseuille flow, lid driven cavity flow, Womersley flow, Taylor-Couette flow, blood flow applications are taken as benchmarks throughout the thesis.},

abstract = {Finite-difference, time-domain (FDTD) calculations are typically performed with partial differential equations that are first order in time. Equation sets appropriate for FDTD calculations in a moving inhomogeneous medium (with an emphasis on the atmosphere) are derived and discussed in this paper. Two candidate equation sets, both derived from linearized equations of fluid dynamics, are proposed. The first, which contains three coupled equations for the sound pressure, vector acoustic velocity, and acoustic density, is obtained without any approximations. The second, which contains two coupled equations for the sound pressure and vector acoustic velocity, is derived by ignoring terms proportional to the divergence of the medium velocity and the gradient of the ambient pressure. It is shown that the second set has the same or a wider range of applicability than equations for the sound pressure that have been previously used for analytical and numerical studies of sound propagation in a moving atmosphere. Practical FDTD implementation of the second set of equations is discussed. Results show good agreement with theoretical predictions of the sound pressure due to a point monochromatic source in a uniform, high Mach number flow and with Fast Field Program calculations of sound propagation in a stratified moving atmosphere.},

Realistic topography is resolved on a curvilinear grid that follows the interface. The governing equations are discretized using high order accurate finite difference methods that satisfy the principle of summation by parts.

In this study, we apply a multiple-event relocation method to produce a catalog of 3639 central Oklahoma earthquakes from late 2009 through 2014. Regional moment tensor (RMT) source parameters were determined for 195 of the largest and best recorded earthquakes.

abstract = {In a static approach the effects of deviation of Mars from its equilibrium state on the flattening of the core-mantle boundary (CMB) are studied. The calculations are performed for a set of interior structure models with 50- and 100-km thick crust and averaged crustal density varying in the range of 2700-3200 kg m-3, which are based on new values for the moment of inertia and the elastic tidal Love number k2s defined by Konopliv et al. [Konopliv, A.S., Yoder, C.F., Standish, E.M., Yuan, D.-N., Sjorgen, W.L., 2006. A global solution for the Mars static and seasonal gravity, Mars orientation, Phobos and Deimos masses, and Mars ephemeris. Icarus, 182, 23-50]. The models differ in density contrast at the crust-mantle boundary and the core radius. The observational data constrain the radius of a liquid core to be within 1700-1800 km. For joint interpretation of gravity and topography data an outer surface of a hydrostatical model is chosen as a reference surface. The Green's functions (or loading factors) technique for the case of a single anomalous density wave located at two depth level is used to compute the second-degree CMB deformation, and then the CMB flattening. Two types of models have been calculated: an elastic model and a model with an elastic lithosphere and weakened layers below it (relaxed values of shear modulus); the effective shear modulus of the mantle is reduced in comparison with an elastic one and in extreme case it is approaching zero everywhere except the elastic lithosphere. Non-equilibrium state of Mars results in three-axiality of the core-mantle boundary. For an elastic case the deformation of CMB leads to the large decrease of the semiaxis b, going through the central region of Tharsis rise, by 660-780 m, and the increase of the equatorial semiaxis a by 240-300 m, and the polar axis c by 400-490 m. Tharsis rise plays a constitutive role for the CMB deformation. The second-degree harmonics in the expansion of non-equilibrium part of gravity field and topography are sensitive, first of all, to the properties of the crust in the Tharsis region. Non-hydrostatic contributions decrease the flattening of the CMB by about 5-6{\%}. The effect of loading increases when the value of shear modulus decreases by a factor of 10, but as the shear modulus is decreasing up to zero the flattening is approaching its hydrostatic value. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The acoustic radiation which results from the motion of the air/water interface is known to be a nonlinear effect. The second-order nonlinear contribution to the acoustic radiation is computed and the statistical properties of the received microbarom signals are related to the statistical properties of the ocean wave system. The physical mechanisms and source strengths for radiation into the atmosphere and ocean are compared. The observed ratio of atmospheric to oceanic microbarom peak pressure levels (approximately 1 to 1000) is explained.},

abstract = {Time dependent numerical models for hyperbolic systems, such as the fluid dynamics equations, require time dependent boundary conditions when the systems are solved in a finite domain. The "correct" boundary condition depends on the external solution, but for many problems the external solution is not known. In such cases nonreflecting boundary conditions often produce solutions with the desired behavior. This paper extends the concept of nonreflecting boundary conditions to the multidimensional case in non-rectangular coordinate systems. Results are given for several fluid dynamics test problems: the traveling shock wave, shock tube, spherical explosion, and homologous expansion problems in one dimension, and a traveling shock wave moving at a 45° angle with respect to the x axis in two dimensions. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

This sequence included a foreshock with a moment magnitude ( M w ) of 6.4 followed by a M w 7.1 mainshock nearly 34 hours later. Geodetic, seismic, and seismicity data provided an integrative view of this sequence, which ruptured an unmapped multiscale network of interlaced orthogonal faults. This complex fault geometry persists over the entire seismogenic depth range. The rupture of the mainshock terminated only a few kilometers from the major regional Garlock fault, triggering shallow creep and a substantial earthquake swarm. The repeated occurrence of multifault ruptures, as revealed by modern instrumentation and analysis techniques, poses a formidable challenge in quantifying regional seismic hazards.},

abstract = {It is thought that the Earth's outer core consists mainly of liquid iron and that the convection of this metallic liquid gives rise to the Earth's magnetic field. A full understanding of this convection is hampered, however, by uncertainty regarding the viscosity of the outer core. Viscosity estimates from various sources span no less than 12 orders of magnitude, and it seems unlikely that this uncertainty will be substantially reduced by experimental measurements in the near future. Here we present dynamical first-principles simulations of liquid iron which indicate that the viscosity of iron at core temperatures and pressures is at the low end of the range of previous estimates-roughly 10 times that of typical liquid metals at ambient pressure. This estimate supports the approximation commonly made in magnetohydrodynamic models that the outer core is an inviscid fluid undergoing small-scale circulation and turbulent convection, rather than large-scale global circulation.},

Except for VS, all the quantities VP, QP-1 and QS-1 are dependent on grain size and are higher in coarser grains than in fine grains. QS-1 decreases significantly with increasing differential pressure in coarse grained sediments, but the same sediments show an anomalous increase with differential pressure in QP-1 at low pressures. Th VP, VS, QP-1, and QS-1 of these samples is also modelled. The Contact Radius model with surface force effects predicts both VP and VS to be dependent on grain size. Frictional losses in unconsolidated coarse-grained sands must also be considered at small strains (10-7). Velocity and losses measured in saturated sands are higher than those predicted by the Biot model, which does not account for any grain size dependence on the seismic qualities. -from Authors},

Special attention is paid to the treatment of boundary conditions and to the stabilization of the method in the vicinity of discontinuities avoiding the Gibbs phenomenon. As a result we obtain a technique allowing the numerical solution of flows with practically all Mach numbers without any modification of the Euler equations. This means that the proposed method can be used for the solution of high speed flows as well as low Mach number flows. Presented numerical tests prove the accuracy of the method and its robustness with respect to the Mach number. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Acoustical Society of America. The transmission of airborne sound into high-impedance media is of interest in several applications. For example, sonic booms in the atmosphere may impact marine life when incident on the ocean surface, or affect the integrity of existing structures when incident on the ground. Transmission across high impedance-difference interfaces is generally limited by reflection and refraction at the surface, and by the critical angle criterion. However, spatially decaying incident waves, i.e., inhomogeneous or evanescent plane waves, may transmit energy above the critical angle, unlike homogeneous plane waves. The introduction of a decaying component to the incident trace wavenumber creates a nonzero propagating component of the transmitted normal wavenumber, so energy can be transmitted across the interface. A model of evanescent plane waves and their transmission across fluid-fluid and fluid-solid interfaces is developed here. Results are presented for both air-water and air-solid interfaces. The effects of the incident wave parameters (including the frequency, decay rate, and incidence angle) and the interfacial properties are investigated. Conditions for which there is no reflection at the air-solid interface, due to impedance matching between the incident and transmitted waves, are also considered and are found to yield substantial transmission increases over homogeneous incident waves.},

Science 278, 1749-1752), together with the VSOP87 representation of planetary orbits (Bretagnon and Francou, 1988. Astron. Astrophys. 202, 209-315), have been applied to a new evaluation of the right ascension of the "Fictitious Mean Sun" (FMS) at Mars. With $\Delta$tJ2000 the elapsed time in days from the J2000 epoch (JD 2451545.0TT), $\alpha$FMS = 270°.3863 + 0.5240384(°/d){\textperiodcentered}$\Delta$tJ2000-4 × 10-13(°/d2){\textperiodcentered}$\Delta$t2J2000 represents a best least-squares quadratic fit of the FMS, including aberration, to each instance of the four equinox and solstice passages for each of 134 Mars orbits spanning the calendar years 1874-2126. The implied tropical orbit period for Mars, 686.9726d, closely agrees with the recent evaluations by Sur{\'{a}}n (1997. Planet. Space Sci. 45, 705-708) and Allison (1997. Geophys. Rev. Lett. 24, 1967-1970). Together with the Pathfinder radio determination of the Mars sidereal rotation, the derived FMS rate corresponds to a mean solar day (or "sol") of 1.02749125d. The new FMS determination would serve to define the Mean Solar Time at Mars to the nearest tenth-second, according to historical conventions originally established for terrestrial time-keeping, once the Mars prime meridian defined by the crater Airy-0 is determined within inertial space to the same accuracy. For convenient reference to current epochs, 2000 January 06 00:00:00 UTC (= MJD 51549.000UTC) corresponds to a coincidence of $\alpha$FMS and the rotation angle of the crater Airy-0 measured with respect to the Mars equinox (i.e. "mean solar midnight" on the planet's prime meridian), to within the current uncertainty in the locational definition of the planet's cartographic grid. As a further result of the analysis, the consistently derived Mars obliquity of date is ∈ = 25°.192 + 3.45 × 10-7(°/d){\textperiodcentered}$\Delta$tJ2000. An improved analytic recipe for the calculation of the solar areocentric longitude (LS) of Mars to an accuracy better than 0°.01 is also provided, accounting for the primary perturbations of Earth, Jupiter, and Venus, which may in turn be applied to an efficient evaluation of Mars Local True Solar Time (LTST) to within the uncertainty of the inertial position of the Mars prime meridian. For specific applications to the data archives for landed Mars spacecraft, simple conversion formulae are given for the determination of the Viking "Local Lander Time" and the Pathfinder "Local True Solar Time" in terms of the terrestrial calendar date and UTC. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {The Navier–Stokes equations are solved using a finite-difference, time-domain (FDTD) approach for axi-symmetric environmental models, allowing three-dimensional acoustic propagation to be simulated using a two-dimensional Cylindrical coordinate system. A method to stabilize the FDTD algorithm in a viscous medium at atmospheric densities characteristic of the lower thermosphere is described. The stabilization scheme slightly alters the governing equations but results in quantifiable dispersion characteristics. It is shown that this method leaves sound speeds and attenuation unchanged at frequencies that are well resolved by the temporal sampling rate but strongly attenuates higher frequencies. Numerical experiments are performed to assess the effect of source strength on the amplitudes and spectral content of signals recorded at ground level at a range of distances from the source. It is shown that the source amplitudes have a stronger effect on a signal's dominant frequency than on its amplitude. Applying...},

abstract = {The science of rock physics addresses the relationships between geophysical observations and the underlying physical properties of rocks, such as composition, porosity, and pore fluid content. The Rock Physics Handbook distills a vast quantity of background theory and laboratory results into a series of concise, self-contained chapters, which can be quickly accessed by those seeking practical solutions to problems in geophysical data interpretation. In addition to the wide range of topics presented in the First Edition (including wave propagation, effective media, elasticity, electrical properties, and pore fluid flow and diffusion), this Second Edition also presents major new chapters on granular material and velocity–porosity–clay models for clastic sediments. Other new and expanded topics include anisotropic seismic signatures, nonlinear elasticity, wave propagation in thin layers, borehole waves, models for fractured media, poroelastic models, attenuation models, and cross-property relations between seismic and electrical parameters. This new edition also provides an enhanced set of appendices with key empirical results, data tables, and an atlas of reservoir rock properties expanded to include carbonates, clays, and gas hydrates. Supported by a website hosting MATLAB routines for implementing the various rock physics formulas presented in the book, the Second Edition of The Rock Physics Handbook is a vital resource for advanced students and university faculty, as well as in-house geophysicists and engineers working in the petroleum industry. It will also be of interest to practitioners of environmental geophysics, geomechanics, and energy resources engineering interested in quantitative subsurface characterization and modeling of sediment properties.},

abstract = {On clear nights, over flat land, a sound duct develops in which sound can carry to great distances. As is the case with all ducted propagation, there is strong dispersion so that a broadband signal undergoes severe distortion as it propagates. The signal received at long ranges from an impulsive source is a wave train, of much greater duration than the initial impulse, consisting of a series of arrivals. The long range ground to ground propagation of an impulsive signal in a typical nocturnal duct is studied and the natures of the various arrivals are explained. A direct connection is drawn between the meteorological and ground conditions and the structure of the propagated signal.},

abstract = {Infrasound and longer-period acoustic gravity waves have been of considerable interest since barometers around the world inadvertently recorded infrasound from the 1883 eruption of Krakatau (Evers and Haak 2010). Early recordings showed that, at low frequencies, there is relatively little intrinsic attenuation, facilitating the detection and characterization of large events over great ranges (e.g., Landau and Lifshitz 1959). Infrasound was used to locate enemy artillery in WWI. Infrasound was used as a monitoring tool during the early proliferation of nuclear weapon technologies after WWII when nuclear tests were routinely conducted in the atmosphere. In 1963, the Limited Test Ban Treaty was signed by most nations, and nuclear testing generally went underground. Interest in infrasound as a moni- toring tool waned as interest in global seismology increased.},

abstract = {Electron work functions, surface potentials, and electron number density distributions and electric fields in the surface region of 26 metals are calculated from first principles within the free-electron model. The number of free electrons per atom is taken as the group number as listed in the Periodic Table. Grain orientation effects are not considered. The calculation proceeds from an expression of the total energy as a functional of the electron number density including exchange and correlation energies as well as a first inhomogeneity term. The self-consistent solution is then obtained via a variational procedure akin to the Ritz method. Surface barriers are found, in most cases, to be due principally to many-body effects, but dipole barriers are small only for a number of alkali metals, becoming quite large for the transition metals. As one might expect, surface energies are found to be inadequately described by this model which neglects atomistic effects. Considering the simplicity of the model, reasonable results are obtained for electron work functions and surface potential characteristics for all metals studied, maximum electron densities varying by a factor of over 60.},

During the experiment, atmospheric sound levels in the 0.5–20 Hz frequency band were associated with large breaking ocean waves. The envelope of surf infrasound signals yields breaking wave periods comparable to those derived from nearshore sea surface elevation measurements. Our analysis confirms that individual plunging waves are partly responsible for the generation of surf infrasound. We demonstrate the potential to extract breaking wave period from a single, well sited infrasonic microphone.},

abstract = {A direct numerical simulation of the three-dimensional unsteady compressible Navier-Stokes equations is performed to investigate the infrasonic field generated in a realistic atmosphere by an explosive source placed at ground level. To this end, a high-order finite-difference method originally developed for aeroacoustic applications is employed. The maximum overpressure and the main frequency of the signal recorded at 4km distance from the source location are about 4000 Pa and 0.2 Hz, respectively. The atmosphere is parametrized as a vertically stratified medium, constructed by specifying vertical profiles of the temperature and the horizontal wind which reproduce measurements. The computation is carried out up to 140 km altitude and 450 km range. The goal of the present paper is twofold. On the one hand, the feasibility of using a direct numerical simulation of the three-dimensional fluid dynamic equations for the detailed description of long-range propagation in the atmosphere is proven. On the other hand, a physical analysis of the infrasonic field is realized. In particular, great attention is directed towards some important phenomena which are not taken into account or not well predicted by classical propagation models. To begin with, the present study clearly demonstrates that the weakly nonlinear ray theory may lead to an incorrect evaluation of the waveform distortion of high-amplitude waves propagating towards the lower thermosphere. In addition, signals recorded in the shadow zones are investigated. In this regard, the influence on the acoustic field of temperature and wind inhomogeneities of length scale comparable with the acoustic wavelength is analysed. The role of diffraction at the thermospheric caustic is finally examined and it is pointed out that the amplitude of the source may have a strong impact on the length of the shadow zone.},

abstract = {The Mars Orbiter Camera on board the Mars Global Surveyor from March 9, 1999 (Ls=107°, where Ls is the areocentric longitude of the Sun measured in degrees from Mars' northern spring equinox), to December 31, 1999 (Ls=274°), has obtained 7.5 km pixel-1 daily global maps of the Martian surface in two wavelength bands: blue (400-450 nm) and red (575-625 nm). Visual inspection of these maps during the 1999 dust storm season has resulted in the detection of 783 dust storms, ranging in size from "local" ({\textgreater}102 km2) to "regional" ({\textgreater}1.6×106 km2). No global storms were observed. The difference in the numbers of dust storms occurring in the two hemispheres (north: 343; south: 440) was not statistically significant. Fifty percent of the regional size dust storms formed as a result of the "merger" of two or more smaller local storms. The regional storms from Ls = 207° to Ls = 223° were observed to move from the northern hemisphere into the southern hemisphere between 30°W and 50°W longitude. This cross-equatorial transport of dust suggests the location of the low-lying southward flowing branch of the Hadley circulation. Observations show that dust storms occur in several regions on Mars: at the two polar cap edges, at the base of high elevation regions in the northern hemisphere, near the polar hood during northern fall, and at mid-latitudes in both hemispheres. Specific regions such as Solis Planum and Hesperia, which were regions of significant dust activity in the past, showed almost no dust storm activity in 1999, suggesting that regional dust sources are variable over a 20-year time frame. One region of exceptional activity not noted previously was the Arcadia-Amazonis border. However, other regions, such as near Elysium Mons, Acidalia, Chryse, Hellas, Noachis, Argyre, Cimmeria, and Sirenum, again were active dust storm regions. Relative dust opacities were modeled for 117 red wavelength events and ranged from 0.54 "diffuse haze" to 2.13 "concentrated local events." From the dust opacities we estimated the north polar sedimentation rate to be 6.0-10×10×10-4 g cm-2 yr-1, a factor of 40 smaller than previous estimates from the two 1977 global dust storms [Pollack et al., 1979], along with the global dust mass loading (2.6-4.0×10-4 g cm-2) and cross-equatorial dust mass loading (3.6×10-4 g cm-2). The 1999 cross-equatorial mass dust loading suggests that the southern hemisphere subtropical latitudes require at least 2-3 Martian years to replenish their dust sources before global storms can form.

abstract = {We describe a set of two ``new generation'' general circulation models of the Martian atmosphere derived from the models we originally developed in the early 1990s. The two new models share the same physical parameterizations but use two complementary numerical methods to solve the atmospheric dynamic equations. The vertical resolution near the surface has been refined, and the vertical domain has been extended to above 80 km. These changes are accompanied by the inclusion of state-of-the -art parameterizations to better simulate the dynamical and physical processes near the surface (boundary layer scheme, subgrid-scale topography parameterization, etc.) and at high altitude (gravity wave drag). In addition, radiative transfer calculations and the representation of polar processes have been significantly improved. We present some examples of zonal-mean fields from simulations using the model at several seasons. One relatively novel aspect, previously introduced by Wilson [1997], is that around northern winter solstice the strong pole to pole diabatic forcing creates a quasi-global, angular-momentum conserving Hadley cell which has no terrestrial equivalent. Within such a cell the Coriolis forces accelerate the winter meridional flow toward the pole and induce a strong warming of the middle polar atmosphere down to 25 km. This winter polar warming had been observed but not properly modeled until recently. In fact, thermal inversions are generally predicted above one, and often both, poles around 60-70 km. However, the Mars middle atmosphere above 40 km is found to be very model-sensitive and thus difficult to simulate accurately in the absence of observations.},

abstract = {To facilitate infrasound propagation studies, we present AVO-G2S, an open-source, Ground-to-Space model which provides temperature and wind specifications from the surface to an altitude of 225 km. This model provides a means of smoothly characterizing atmospheric conditions using multiple numerical weather prediction forecast and reanalysis products, along with upper-atmospheric empirical models. Regional atmospheric reconstructions only require a limited domain and can utilize high-resolution numerical weather prediction forecasts typically provided on a projected grid. The use of a projected grid allows for faster spectral transform libraries to be employed. The AVO-G2S software can also provide global reconstructions that rely on global numerical weather prediction products and spherical harmonic decompositions. AVO-G2S is inspired by a global Ground-to-Space model developed by the Naval Research Laboratory, and relies on their empirical descriptions of upper-atmospheric conditions. Alaska Volcano Observatory has implemented this model for near-real-time infrasound monitoring of volcanic eruptions and historical research projects.},

abstract = {The propagation of small perturbations in complex geometries can involve hydrodynamic-acoustic interactions, coupling acoustic waves and vortical modes. A propagation model, based on the linearized Navier–Stokes equations, is proposed. It includes the mechanism responsible for the generation of vorticity associated with the hydrodynamic modes. The linearized Navier–Stokes equations are discretized in space using a discontinuous Galerkin formulation for unstructured grids. Explicit time integration and non-reflecting boundary conditions are described. The linearized Navier–Stokes (LNS) model is applied to two test cases. The first one is the time-harmonic source line in an incompressible inviscid two-dimensional mean shear flow in an infinite domain. It is shown that the proposed model is able to capture the trailing vorticity field developing behind the mass source and to represent the redistribution of the vorticity. The second test case deals with the analysis of the acoustic propagation of an incoming perturbation inside a circular duct with a sudden area expansion in the presence of a mean flow and the evaluation of its scattering matrix. The computed coefficients of the scattering matrix are compared to experimental data for three different Mach numbers of the mean flow, M 0 = 0.08, 0.19 and 0.29. The good agreement with the experimental data shows that the proposed method is suitable for characterizing the acoustic behavior of this kind of network.},

abstract = {The climate of Mars likely evolved from a warmer, wetter early state to the cold, arid current state. However, no solutions for this evolution have previously been found to satisfy the observed geological features and isotopic measurements of the atmosphere. Here we show that a family of solutions exist, invoking no missing reservoirs or loss processes. Escape of carbon via CO photodissociation and sputtering enriches heavy carbon (13 C) in the Martian atmosphere, partially compensated by moderate carbonate precipitation. The current atmospheric 13 C/ 12 C and rock and soil carbonate measurements indicate an early atmosphere with a surface pressure {\textless}1 bar. Only scenarios with large amounts of carbonate formation in open lakes permit higher values up to 1.8 bar. The evolutionary scenarios are fully testable with data from the MAVEN mission and further studies of the isotopic composition of carbonate in the Martian rock record through time.},

abstract = {Meteoroid falls on the Moon produce transient luminous events usually named impact flashes. These emissions have been reported by several independent observers using ground-based telescopes over the last decade. We present here a compendium of these observations for the period 1999-2007, including apparent flash magnitudes, durations and the origin of the bolide (meteor shower or sporadic impact). Impact flashes appear on 1-10 camera frames corresponding to durations ranging from {\~{}}10. ms to {\~{}}1. s. The analysis of these data reveals a correlation between duration and intensity, with the exception of Leonid meteors. The difference between Leonids and other meteoroids are likely explained by the higher velocity of this swarm. For the other events, the observed trend implies that impact flash detections are at present limited by the frame rate which is generally equal or less than 60 frames par second (f/s). The durations of these transient events are typically longer than predictions based on expanding plasma-gas clouds. We thus argue that these luminous events correspond to radiation emitted by a cloud composed of gas and small ejected melt droplets. A simple model considering the black body radiation of cooling droplets provides a time scale commensurable with the observations. In addition, such modeling is useful for optimizing the specifications of monitoring equipment. In particular, the inferred range of effective temperatures implies that near-infrared observations would efficiently increase the number of detections, whereas multi-spectral observations are essential to progress in the understanding of the nature of these luminous events. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

The objective of this paper is to assess how different boundary conditions impact the performance of compact discontinuous high-order spectral element methods (such as the discontinuous Galerkin method and the Flux Reconstruction approach), when these schemes are used to solve the Euler and compressible Navier-Stokes equations on unstructured grids. Specifically, the paper will investigate inflow/outflow and wall boundary conditions. In all studies the boundary conditions were enforced by modifying the boundary flux. For Riemann invariant (characteristic), slip and no-slip conditions we have considered a direct and an indirect enforcement of the boundary conditions, the first obtained by calculating the flux using the known solution at the given boundary while the second achieved by using a ghost state and by solving a Riemann problem. All computations were performed using the open-source software Nektar++ (www.nektar.info).},

The purpose of the project is to develop a finite-difference, time-domain (FDTD) capability for simulating the acoustic signals received by battlefield acoustic sensors. Many important effects, such as scattering from trees and buildings, interactions with dynamic atmospheric wind and temperature fields, and nonstationary target properties, can be accommodated by the simulation. Such a capability has much potential for mitigating the need for costly field data collection and furthering the development of robust identification and tracking algorithms. The FDTD code is based on a carefully derived set of first-order differential equations that is more general and accurate than most current sound propagation formulations. For application to three-dimensional problems of practical interest in battlefield acoustics, the code must be run on massively parallel computers. Some example computations involving sound propagation in a moving atmosphere and propagation in the presence of trees and barriers are presented.},

abstract = {By the end of 2018, 42 years after the landing of the two Viking seismometers on Mars, InSight will deploy onto Mars' surface the SEIS (Seismic Experiment for Internal Structure) instrument; a six-axes seismometer equipped with both a long-period three-axes Very Broad Band (VBB) instrument and a three-axes short-period (SP) instrument. These six sensors will cover a broad range of the seismic bandwidth, from 0.01 Hz to 50 Hz, with possible extension to longer periods. Data will be transmitted in the form of three continuous VBB components at 2 sample per second (sps), an estimation of the short period energy content from the SP at 1 sps and a continuous compound VBB/SP vertical axis at 10 sps. The continuous streams will be augmented by requested event data with sample rates from 20 to 100 sps. SEIS will improve upon the existing resolution of Viking's Mars seismic monitoring by a factor of ∼2500{\$}\backslashsim 2500{\$}at 1 Hz and ∼200000{\$}\backslashsim 200\backslash,000{\$}at 0.1 Hz. An additional major improvement is that, contrary to Viking, the seismometers will be deployed via a robotic arm directly onto Mars' surface and will be protected against temperature and wind by highly efficient thermal and wind shielding. Based on existing knowledge of Mars, it is reasonable to infer a moment magnitude detection threshold of Mw∼3{\$}M{\_}{\{}{\{}w{\}}{\}} \backslashsim 3{\$}at 40∘{\$}40{\^{}}{\{}\backslashcirc{\}}{\$}epicentral distance and a potential to detect several tens of quakes and about five impacts per year. In this paper, we first describe the science goals of the experiment and the rationale used to define its requirements. We then provide a detailed description of the hardware, from the sensors to the deployment system and associated performance, including transfer functions of the seismic sensors and temperature sensors. We conclude by describing the experiment ground segment, including data processing services, outreach and education networks and provide a description of the format to be used for future data distribution.},

abstract = {The Viking Orbiters imaged early morning, long, linear wave clouds along the flanks of the Tharsis volcanoes during late northern spring and early summer. These clouds are believed to be a product of either an atmospheric bore wave or a hydraulic jump generated by nightly katabatic winds. The Mars Regional Atmospheric Modeling System was used to study the interaction of the katabatic flows with the surrounding atmosphere to determine what mechanism is responsible for the clouds. Simulations at Ls = 90 °, 100°, 142°, 180°, 270°, and 358° were conducted focusing on the eastern flank of Olympus Mons. Model results compare well with Viking observations and closely approximate theoretical treatments of atmospheric bores. Strong downslope flows are simulated during the night, with a bore wave forming on and behind a well-defined katabatic front. The observed seasonality of the clouds was reproduced in the simulations; the bore was deeper and faster during northern summer and weakest during the winter. When the bore was strong, it was undular in form, and generated vertically propagating gravity waves in the atmosphere above. During the winter, the atmospheric structure was such that any gravity waves generated damped with height. Less atmospheric water vapor abundance during northern winter, as compared to the summer, is also a factor in the seasonality of the wave clouds. This study concludes that bore waves are the most likely mechanism for the generation of the observed linear wave clouds. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Infrasound is routinely observed at infrasound arrays from the International Mon-itoring System, in place for the verification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Association and source identification are key elements of the verification system. The moving nature of a rocket is a defining criterion, in order to distinguish it from an isolated explosion. Here, it is shown how infrasound recordings can be associated, which leads to identification of the rocket. Propagation modeling is included to further constrain the source identification. Four rocket launches by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in 2009 and 2017 are analyzed, in which multiple arrays detected the infrasound. Source identification in this region is impor-tant for verification purposes. It is concluded that with a passive monitoring technique such as infrasound, characteristics can be remotely obtained on sources of interest, i.e., infrasonic intelligence, over 4500+ km.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Authors 2017. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Royal Astronomical Society. A new method using a machine learning technique is applied to event classification anddetection at seismic networks. This method is applicable to a variety of network sizes andsettings. The algorithm makes use of a small catalogue of known observations across theentire network. Two attributes, the polarization and frequency content, are used as input toregression. These attributes are extracted at predicted arrival times for P and Swaves using onlyan approximate velocity model, as attributes are calculated over large time spans. This methodof waveformcharacterization is shown to be able to distinguish between blasts and earthquakeswith 99 per cent accuracy using a network of 13 stations located in Southern California. Thecombination of machine learning with generalized waveform features is further applied toevent detection in Oklahoma, United States. The event detection algorithm makes use of apair of unique seismic phases to locate events, with a precision directly related to the samplingrate of the generalized waveform features. Over a week of data from 30 stations in Oklahoma,United States are used to automatically detect 25 times more events than the catalogue ofthe local geological survey, with a false detection rate of less than 2 per cent. This methodprovides a highly confident way of detecting and locating events. Furthermore, a large numberof seismic events can be automatically detected with low false alarm, allowing for a largerautomatic event catalogue with a high degree of trust.},

abstract = {A non-reflecting buffer zone-type boundary condition based on grid stretching and attenuation methods is presented for computational aeroacoustics. Energy of outgoing wave content is aggressively transferred into increasingly higher wavenumber modes via grid stretching and this high wavenumber (frequency) content is annihilated using a high-order, implicit low-pass filter. The linearized Euler equations in strong conservative form are recast using a general curvilinear coordinate transformation. Spatial discretization is achieved using a sixth-order compact difference operator and the solution is time-marched with a fourth-order Runge-Kutta integration technique. Numerical examples with uniform mean flow are presented for a periodic acoustic source, convection of a vortical disturbance, and a wall-bounded acoustic disturbance. The numerical solutions match analytic, reference, and published data very well, and demonstrate the effectiveness of this non-reflecting boundary treatment for computational aeroacoustics. INTRODUCTION The equations describing the propagation of acoustic signals, the linearized Euler equations, require numerical methods that are essentially free of dispersion and dissipation. Therefore, high-order spatial discretization schemes and temporal integration techniques that have minimal affect on the resolution characteristics of the spatial scheme are required for accurate simulation. The lack of a viscous (damping) effect in the describing equations means that any spurious errors generated due to numerical boundary treatment may propagate freely, corrupting the acoustic field.},

abstract = {A new interpretation for a complex crystal section across Oklahoma is derived from the unified study of a wide variety of observations. The set of data includes refraction observations from a reversed profile, reflection data, gravity measurements, well log information and knowledge of the near-surface geology. The model is divided into three parts according to the elevation of the basement surface and the properties of the overlying sediments. The upper portion of the crust is characterized by a major low velocity zone that has participated in vertical movements at major faults crossing the profile. Four continuous interfaces underlie this low velocity zone, the deepest being the crust-mantle boundary at a depth of 46 km. The continuity of these surfaces and the vertical displacements above the low velocity region imply that in this area major tectonic movements are restricted to the portion of the crust which lies above the base of the velocity reversal. Crustal mobility in this area may possibly be related to the presence of this low velocity zone. {\textcopyright} 1970, The Geological Society of America, Inc.},

abstract = {PAGES 433,440-441 The rumble of hypersonic objects tearing through the atmosphere can be routinely detected by sensitive infrasound sensors [Brown et al., 2002]. Meteors and reentering spacecraft are the most common hypersonic sources, although supersonic aircraft generate comparable sig­ natures. This article concentrates on two excep­ tionally energetic events: the tragic Columbia reentry of 1 February 2003 (STS-107) and the 23 April 2001 superbolide explosion. On 23 April 2001, a large meteor exploded at a height of -28.5 km between Hawaii and Cali­ fornia. With an estimated explosive energy of -10 k of TNT, this event catalyzed the U.S. infra­ sound community to work with other sectors of government, academia, and industry to provide rapid analyses of any available infrasound, seismic, hydroacoustic, and satellite data that would help identify the explosion source and determine its location. As a result of the precedent for interdiscipli­ nary collaboration established after the 23 April event, on 1 February 2003, the infrasound community was able to respond rapidly and efficiently to the Columbia disaster.The North American infrasound network (Figure 1) detected the Columbia reentry from the coast of Cali­ fornia to its tragic demise over Texas, and provided additional information to government agencies during their interdisciplinary forensic analyses. U.S. stations IS53, IS56, IS57, and IS59 and Canadian station IS 10 are also part of the International Monitoring System (IMS). All infrasound stations of interest here are com­ posed of multiple sensors designed to permit an estimate of the arrival azimuth and apparent propagation speed of a signal across an array Infrasonic signals can be generated in three ways by a hypersonic source.The passage may be recorded as a bow shock with a typical N-wave signature by stations located near the trajectory (Figure 2). Acceleration associated with changes in trajectory can generate addi­ tional shock structure. And lastly a catastrophic explosion can transform substantial kinetic energy into acoustic energy. All of these processes can trap energy into acoustic corridors between the ground and the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere, which may guide infrasonic waves through the atmosphere as they refract at high-velocity zones and reflect from the Earth's surface. Such waveguides permit sound propagation to ranges of thousands of kilome­ ters. Accurate location and identification of distant acoustic sources in the atmosphere strongly depends on an understanding of the propagation path of the observed sound waves.},

Gradient winds from CIRA-86 plus rocket soundings, incoherent scatter radar, MF radar, and meteor radar provide the data base and are supplemented by previous data driven model summaries. Low-order spherical harmonics and Fourier series are used to describe the major variations throughout the atmosphere including latitude, annual, semiannual, local time (tides), and longitude (stationary wave 1), with a cubic spline interpolation in altitude. The model represents a smoothed compromise between the original data sources. Although agreement between various data sources is generally good, some systematic differences are noted, particularly near the mesopause. Overall root mean square differences between dar.a and model values are on the order of 15 m/s in the mesosphere and 10 m/s in the stratosphere for zonal winds, and 10 m/s and 5 m/s respectively for meridional winds.},

abstract = {In order to discriminate between quarry blasts and earthquakes observed in the Dobrogea seismogenic region, a seismo-acoustic analysis was performed on 520 events listed in the updated Romanian seismic catalogue from January 2011 to December 2012. During this time interval, 104 seismo-acoustic events observed from a distance between 110 and 230 km and backazimuth interval of 110–160° from the IPLOR infrasound array were identified as explosions by associating with infrasonic signals. WinPMCC software for interactive analysis was applied to detect and characterize infrasonic signals in terms of backazimuth, speed and frequency content. The measured and expected values of both backazimuths and arrival times for the study events were compared in order to identify the sources of infrasound. Two predominant directions for seismo-acoustic sources' aligning were observed, corresponding to the northern and central parts of Dobrogea, and these directions are further considered as references in the process of discriminating explosions from earthquakes. A predominance of high-frequency detections (above 1 Hz) is also observed in the infrasound data. The strong influence of seasonally dependent stratospheric winds on the IPLOR detection capability limits the efficiency of the discrimination procedure, as proposed by this study.},

abstract = {Pressure fluctuations are an important ingredient in turbulence, e.g. in the pressure strain terms which redistribute turbulence among the different fluctuating velocity components. The variation of the pressure fluctuations inside a turbulent boundary layer has hitherto been out of reach of experimental determination. The mechanisms of non-local pressure-related coupling between the different regions of the boundary layer have therefore remained poorly understood. One reason for this is the difficulty inherent in measuring the fluctuating pressure. We have developed a new technique to measure pressure fluctuations. In the present study, both mean and fluctuating pressure, wall pressure, and streamwise velocity have been measured simultaneously in turbulent boundary layers up to Reynolds numbers based on the momentum thickness R$\theta$ ≃ 20 000. Results on mean and fluctuation distributions, spectra, Reynolds number dependence, and correlation functions are reported. Also, an attempt is made to test, for the first time, the existence of Kolmogorov's -7/3 power-law scaling of the pressure spectrum in the limit of high Reynolds numbers in a turbulent boundary layer. {\textcopyright} 2007 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {The first in situ sounding of a post-seismic infrasound wavefront is presented, using data from the GOCE mission. The atmospheric infrasounds following the great Tohoku earthquake (on 11 March 2011) induce variations of air density and vertical acceleration of the GOCE platform. These signals are detected at two positions along the GOCE orbit corresponding to a crossing and a doubling of the infrasonic wavefront created by seismic surface waves. Perturbations up to 11{\%} of air density and 1.35 × 10 − 7 m/s2 of vertical acceleration are observed and modeled with two different solid-atmosphere coupling codes. These perturbations are a due to acoustic waves creating vertical velocities up to 130 m/s. Amplitudes and arrival times of these perturbations are reproduced respectively within a factor 2, and within a 60 s time window. Waveforms present a good agreement with observed data. The vertical acceleration to air density perturbation ratio is higher for these acoustic waves than for gravity waves. Combining these two pieces of information offers a new way to distinguish between these two wave types. This new type of data is a benchmark for the models of solid-atmosphere coupling. Amplitude and frequency content constrain the infrasound attenuation related to atmosphere viscosity and thermal conductivity. Observed time shifts between data and synthetics are ascribed to lateral variations of the seismic and atmospheric sound velocities and to the influence of atmospheric winds. These effects should be included in future modeling. This validation of our modeling tools allows to specify more precisely future observation projects.},

abstract = {In this work, numerical simulations of the atmospheric and ionospheric anomalies are performed for the Tohoku-Oki tsunami (2011 March 11). The Tsunami-Atmosphere-Ionosphere (TAI) coupling mechanism via acoustic gravity waves (AGWs) is explored theoretically using the TAI-coupled model. For the modelled tsunami wave as an input, the coupled model simulates the wind, density and temperature disturbances or anomalies in the atmosphere and electron density/magnetic anomalies in the F region of the ionosphere. Also presented are the GPS-total electron content (TEC) and ground-based magnetometer measurements during the first hour of tsunami and good agreements are found between modelled and observed anomalies. At first, within 6 min from the tsunami origin, the simulated wind anomaly at 250 km altitude and TEC anomaly appear as the dipole-shaped disturbances around the epicentre, then as the concentric circular wave fronts radially moving away from the epicentre with the horizontal velocity ∼800 ms -1 after 12 min followed by the slow moving (horizontal velocity ∼250 ms -1) wave disturbance after 30 min. The detailed vertical-horizontal propagation characteristics suggest that the anomalies appear before and after 30 min are associated with the acoustic and gravity waves, respectively. Similar propagation characteristics are found from the GPS-TEC and magnetic measurements presented here and also reported from recent studies. The modelled magnetic anomaly in the F region ionosphere is found to have similar temporal variations with respect to the epicentre distance as that of the magnetic anomaly registered from the ground-based magnetometers. The high-frequency component ∼10 min of the simulated wind, TEC and magnetic anomalies in the F region develops within 6-7 min after the initiation of the tsunami, suggesting the importance of monitoring the high-frequency atmospheric/ionospheric anomalies for the early warning. These anomalies are found to maximize across the epicentre in the direction opposite to the tsunami propagation suggesting that the large atmospheric/ionospheric disturbances are excited in the region where tsunami does not travel. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors Geophysical Journal International {\textcopyright} 2012 RAS.},

abstract = {Coda waves from small local earthquakes are interpreted as backscattering waves from numerous heterogeneities distributed uniformly in the earth's crust. Two extreme models of the wave medium that account for the observations on the coda are proposed. In the single backscattering model the scattering is considered to be a weak process, and the loss of seismic energy by scattering is neglected. In the diffusion model the seismic energy transfer is considered as a diffusion process. Both models lead to similar formulas that allow an accurate separation of the effect of earthquake source from the effects of scattering and attenuation on the coda spectra. A unique difference was found in the scaling law of earthquake source spectra between central California and western Japan, which may be attributed to the difference in inhomogeneity length of the earth's crust. The Q of coda waves in the two regions is strongly frequency dependent with values increasing from 50–200 at 1 Hz to about 1000–2000 at 20 Hz. This observation is interpreted as a combined effect of variation of Q with depth and frequency-dependent composition of coda waves described below. The turbidity coefficient of the lithosphere required at 1 Hz to explain the observed coda as body wave scattering is orders of magnitude greater than previously known values such as those obtained by Aki (1973) and Capon (1974) under the Montana Lasa from the amplitude and phase fluctuations of teleseismic P waves. From the high attenuation and turbidity obtained at this frequency we conclude that at around 1 Hz the coda is made of backscattering surface waves from heterogeneities in the shallow, low-Q lithosphere. The high Q observed for the coda at frequencies higher than 10 Hz, on the other hand, eliminates the possibility that these waves are backscattering surface waves. We conclude that at these high frequencies the coda must be made of backscattering body waves from heterogeneities in the deep lithosphere. The low turbidities found for deep earthquake sources under western Japan are consistent with this model of coda wave generation.},

@phdthesis{Martire2020,
abstract = {This thesis focuses on the mechanical coupling between a planet's solid body and its atmosphere. We study natural and anthropogenic geophysical events under the scope of seismic waves and infrasound. These phenomena are keys to uncover the atmospheric structure of Earth, the interior of Venus, and Mars as a whole. Acoustic and seismic waveforms contain valuable information, about both the source event and the propagation medium. Our work is two-fold. Firstly, we develop a numerical simulation software for the coupled ground-atmosphere system. We rely on the linearised Navier-Stokes equations to model the atmosphere, and on visco-elastodynamics to model the sub-surface. We employ a discontinuous spectral finite elements method, allowing the simulation of full waveforms. The implementation is validated using two techniques: analytical and manufactured solutions. Our software can model all types of air-ground couplings, and accurately accounts for acoustic and seismic wave propagation. Complex topographies can be used, as well as range-dependant atmospheric models. As a result, it is particularly well suited to study most geophysical phenomena in planetary atmospheres. Example events include seismic waves, microbaroms, underground and overground explosions, or gravity waves. Secondly, we study numerous application cases related to the aforementioned planetary science objectives. With the exploration of Venus' interior in mind, we conduct terrestrial experiments to study seismically-induced infrasound, and involve balloon-borne instruments. We show that it is possible to infer the properties and structure of the sub-surface from these infrasonic waves. These instrumented balloons also render the localisation of ground events possible, which is crucial both for planetary exploration and for the airborne monitoring of the Earth. Finally, we demonstrate that the Martian atmosphere features infrasound, establishing for the first time the existence of infrasound on another planet. This is achieved thanks to InSight's seismometer SEIS, able to measure the faint ground motion caused by passing airwaves.},

Simulations benefit from recent advances in hexahedral meshing, load balancing and software optimization. Meshing may be accomplished using a mesh generation tool kit such as CUBIT, and load balancing is facilitated by graph partitioning based on the SCOTCH library. Coupling between fluid and solid regions is incorporated in a straightforward fashion using domain decomposition. Topography, bathymetry and Moho undulations may be readily included in the mesh, and physical dispersion and attenuation associated with anelasticity are accounted for using a series of standard linear solids. Finite-frequency Fr{\'{e}}chet derivatives are calculated using adjoint methods in both fluid and solid domains. The software is benchmarked for a layercake model.

abstract = {A variety of Earth surface and atmospheric sources generate low-frequency sound waves that can travel great distances. Despite a rich history of ground-based sensor studies, very few experiments have investigated the prospects of free floating microphone arrays at high altitudes. However, recent initiatives have shown that such networks have very low background noise and may sample an acoustic wave field that is fundamentally different than that at Earth's surface. The experiments have been limited to at most two stations at altitude, making acoustic event detection and localization difficult. We describe the deployment of four drifting microphone stations at altitudes between 21 and 24 km above sea level. The stations detected one of two regional ground-based chemical explosions as well as the ocean microbarom while travelling almost 500 km across the American Southwest. The explosion signal consisted of multiple arrivals; signal amplitudes did not correlate with sensor elevation or source range. The waveforms and propagation patterns suggest interactions with gravity waves at 35–45 km altitude. A sparse network method that employed curved wave front corrections was able to determine the backazimuth from the free flying network to the acoustic source. Episodic signals similar to those seen on previous flights in the same region were noted, but their source remains unclear. Background noise levels were commensurate with those on infrasound stations in the International Monitoring System below 2 s.},

@article{Calais2002,
abstract = {Sources such as atmospheric or buried explosions and shallow earthquakes are known to produce infrasonic pressure waves in the atmosphere Because of the coupling between neutral particles and electrons at ionospheric altitudes, these acoustic and gravity waves induce variations of the ionospheric electron density. The Global Positioning System (GPS) provides a way of directly measuring the total electron content in the ionosphere and, therefore, of detecting such perturbations in the upper atmosphere. In July and August 1996, three large surface mine blasts (1.5Kt each) were detonated at the Black Thunder coal mine in eastern Wyoming. As part of a seismic and acoustic monitoring experiment, we deployed five dual-frequency GPS receivers at distances ranging from 50 to 200km from the mine and were able to detect the ionospheric perturbation caused by the blasts. The perturbation starts 10 to 15 min after the blast, lasts for about 30 min, and propagates with an apparent horizontal velocity of 1200ms−1. Its amplitude reaches 3 × 1014elm−2 in the 7–3 min period band, a value close to the ionospheric perturbation caused by the M=6.7 Northridge earthquake (Calais {\&} Minster 1995). The small signal-to-noise ratio of the perturbation can be improved by slant-stacking the electron content time-series recorded by the different GPS receivers taking into account the horizontal propagation of the perturbation. The energy of the perturbation is concentrated in the 200 to 300s period band, a result consistent with previous observations and numerical model predictions. The 300s band probably corresponds to gravity modes and shorter periods to acoustic modes, respectively. Using a 1-D stratified velocity model of the atmosphere we show that linear acoustic ray tracing fits arrival times at all GPS receivers. We interpret the perturbation as a direct acoustic wave caused by the explosion itself. This study shows that even relatively small subsurface events can produce ionospheric perturbations that are above the detection threshold of the GPS technique. By sensing derivative signals, which can be detected over a relatively broad region, it appears that GPS might be particularly useful for source characterization within the first acoustic quiet zone where infrasound would probably be ineffective. This suggests that dual-frequency GPS monitoring could contribute to Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty verification.},

We present signals recorded during this expedition and suggest that the high frequency signals represent transmissions from the earth, or possible bolide activity. While the source of the high frequency signals is yet unknown we provide a statistical analysis of the content during the flight. Verification of signals using chemical explosions in New Mexico demonstrate that infrasound signals are well recorded on stratospheric stations floating hundreds of km from the source. Comparison of stratospheric floating balloon platforms with ground based (IMS) infrasound stations shows considerable improvement in the noise floor, suggesting that balloon borne signals offer a high fidelity alternative to traditional acoustic installations.},

abstract = {Recent reports on the thermoelastic generation of Lamb waves in isotropic elastic plates show that a laser source efficiently excites a resonance that occurs at the minimum frequency of the first order symmetric (S1) Lamb mode. The group velocity of the Lamb wave goes to zero at this frequency while the phase velocity remains finite, and the resonance is referred to as the S1 zero group velocity (S1 ZGV) resonance. The S1 ZGV resonance can be employed for the nondestructive evaluation of the elastic properties of plates or plate thickness. A model for the generation of elastic waves in plates using an intensity-modulated continuous wave laser source is developed and used to study the behavior of the S1 ZGV resonance. The effects of the laser source parameters on the generation of the S1 ZGV resonance are explored, and the spatial distribution of the displacement produced at the resonance frequency is determined. The predicted displacement spectrum of Lamb waves generated in micron scale plates is found to compare well with experimental measurements. In addition, experimental measurements demonstrate that the S1 ZGV resonance can be used to map subsurface features in thin (4 $\mu$m) membranes at high ultrasonic frequencies (700 MHz). {\textcopyright} 2007 American Institute of Physics.},

Some of the seasonal trends in the microbarom observations can be explained by the winds in the stratosphere and lower mesosphere, while some of the daily variability can be explained by the winds in the troposphere and lower stratosphere. However, coherent energy from powerful swells may overcome the wind-carried microbarom signals and arrive to the station through thermospheric ducting.

abstract = {Infrasounds are acoustic signals of frequency lower than about 20 Hz. They are generated by a large variety of natural events, such as volcanic eruptions or earthquakes, and by artificial sources, like nuclear or chemical explosions and supersonic booms. Infrasonic waves can pro- pagate through the different atmospheric layers up to very large distances, from few hundreds to thousands of kilometres, and can potentially carry relevant information about their source. For this reason, within the framework of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), infrasound recordings are widely employed to monitor clandestine nuclear tests. Infrasound modelling has classically been based on simplified equations. Ray tracing and parabolic models have been the most commonly used techniques. Their efficiency in terms of computational cost is however obtained at the expense of generality and some of the main phenomena affecting infrasound propagation are inherently excluded by these methods. Over the past decade, progress has been made towards the simulation of acoustic propagation by directly solving the fluid dynamics equations. Understandably, this approach is expected to allow a finer description of atmospheric propagation and to lead to a better interpretation of experimental observations. In the present thesis, three main objectives have been achieved. First of all, using ray theory, a characterization of nonlinear effects and absorption induced by thermo-viscous and vibrational relaxation phenomena on the propagation of infrasonic signals generated by explosive sources has been carried out. Direct numerical simulations of the three-dimensional unsteady compres- sible Navier-Stokes equations have been then performed to calculate the sound field generated by an infrasonic source in a realistic atmosphere. Computations have been carried out using a low-dispersive and low-dissipative finite-difference time-domain method, for very large source amplitudes and for source frequencies of order of 0.1 Hz, up to altitudes of 140 km and ranges of few hundreds of kilometres. The scattering from small-scale inhomogeneities, of characteristic dimension of the same order as the wavelength of the infrasonic wave, has been investigated. The penetration in the shadow zone induced by diffraction phenomena at the thermospheric caustic has also been studied. Two-dimensional benchmarks specific to infrasound atmospheric propagation have been finally formulated and reference solutions have been computed. They aim to allow the assessment of the accuracy of numerical solvers as well as the evaluation of the range of validity of the classical approaches.},

The construction of the proposed boundary conditions is based on characteristic analysis and applied for boundaries with arbitrary shape and orientation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed boundary treatment enables to convect out of the computational domain complex flow features with little distortion. In addition, it is shown that small-amplitude acoustic disturbances could be convected out of the computational domain, with no significant deterioration of the overall accuracy of the method. Furthermore, it was found that application of the proposed boundary treatment for viscous flow over a cylinder yields superior performance compared to simple extrapolation methods. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {When applied to wave propagation modeling in anisotropic media, Perfectly Matched Layers (PML) exhibit instabilities. Incoming waves are amplified instead of being absorbed. Overcoming this difficulty is crucial as in many seismic imaging applications, accounting accurately for the subsurface anisotropy is mandatory. In this study, we present the SMART layer method as an alternative to PML approach. This method is based on the decomposition of the wavefield into components propagating inward and outward the domain of interest. Only outgoing components are damped. We show that for elastic and acoustic wave propagation in Transverse Isotropic media, the SMART layer is unconditionally dissipative: no amplification of the wavefield is possible. The SMART layers are not perfectly matched, therefore less accurate than conventional PML. However, a reasonable increase of the layer size yields an accuracy similar to PML. Finally, we illustrate that the selective damping strategy on which is based the SMART method can prevent the generation of spurious S-waves by embedding the source in a small zone where only S-waves are damped.},

abstract = {In September 2014, the ARCES array in Northern Norway was upgraded to consist of 3-component instruments at each of its 25 sites. It is thereby the first array station of the International Monitoring System to be fully 3-component. S-phases are of paramount importance for the detection and location of seismic events at regional distances, especially given sparse station coverage, and it is important that these phases are both detected confidently and attributed accurate slowness estimates. The slowness estimates both identify the phase and provide phase association algorithms with the information necessary to form a high-quality seismic event hypothesis. Prior to September 2014, ARCES had 3-component sensors at four sites only. While these 3-component seismometers were highly beneficial for the detection of regional S-phases, often using incoherent beams, it was often more reliable to perform f-k analysis on the 25 vertical sensors rather than the small number of available horizontal waveforms. In addition to providing an increased signal-to-noise ratio, signals on the horizontal traces are more coherent for the S-phases and display a high measure of semblance over the array. This improves the stability of f-k analysis, since the estimates are less susceptible to the effects of scattering and incoherence. The improved coherence of S-phases across the array aperture on the horizontal components provides the basis for superior secondary phase detection capability using F-detectors and other coherence-based algorithms. Analysis of regional signal coda on the 3-component array indicates different characteristics of the apparent slowness on the different components. The 27 January 2018 earthquake on Novaya Zemlya was the first seismic event close to the former Soviet nuclear test-site to be recorded using the upgraded 3-component ARCES array. We examine the evolution of the slowness pattern for on the different components of the wavetrain and speculate that a continuous f-k detector on three components may be able to detect small seismic events in the eastern Barents Sea with increased robustness and sensitivity. We review the development of the instrumentation at ARCES and explain the motivation behind the hybrid response sensors currently deployed.},

Optimization of ERK methods is done across the broad range of properties, such as stability and accuracy efficiency, linear and nonlinear stability, error control reliability, step change stability, and dissipation/dispersion accuracy, subject to varying degrees of memory economization. Following van der Houwen and Wray, sixteen ERK pairs are presented using from two to five registers of memory per equation, per grid point and having accuracies from third- to fifth-order. Methods have been tested with not only DETEST, but also with the 1 D wave equation. Two of the methods have been applied to the DNS of a compressible jet as well as methane-air and hydrogen-air flames. Derived 3(2) and 4(3) pairs are competitive with existing full-storage methods. Although a substantial efficiency penalty accompanies use of two- and three-register, fifth-order methods, the best contemporary full-storage methods can be nearly matched while still saving 2-3 registers of memory.},

The signals are strongest at 100 Hz and have a secondary peak at 5.4 kHz. These characteristics are consistent with generation by lightning in the Venus atmosphere and the direct propagation of whistler mode signals below the electron gyro frequency and the partial transmission of electromagnetic waves in the presence of electron density inhomogeneities above the electron gyro frequency. The scattering by electron density inhomogeneities may also weaken any correlation with surface topographical features. Thus, the source of these signals may either be intercloud lightning at high altitudes or lightning in volcanic plumes near the ground, despite the large scatter in inferred source locations.},

abstract = {The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Ensemble Prediction System (EPS) is described. In addition to an unperturbed (control) forecast, each ensemble comprises 32 10-day forecasts starting from initial conditions in which dynamically defined perturbations have been added to the operational analysis. The perturbations are constructed from singular vectors of a time-evolution operator linearized around the short-range-forecast trajectory. These singular vectors approximately determine the most unstable phase-space directions in the early part of the forecast period, and are estimated using a forward and adjoint linear version of the ECMWF numerical weather-prediction model. An appropriate norm is chosen, and relationships between the structures of these singular vectors at initial time and patterns showing the sensitivity of short-range forecast error to changes in the analysis are discussed. A methodology to perform a phase-space rotation of the singular vectors is described, which generates hemispheric-wide perturbations and renormalizes them according to analysis-error estimates from the data-assimilation system. The validation of the ensembles is given firstly in terms of scatter diagrams and contingency tables of ensemble spread and control-forecast skill. The contingency tables are compared with those from a perfect-model ensemble system; no significant differences are found in some cases. Brier scores for the probability of European now clusters are presented, which indicate predictive skill up to forecast-day 8 with respect to climatological probabilities. The dependence of these scores on flow-dependent model errors is also discussed. Finally, ensemble-member skill-score distributions are presented, which confirm the overall satisfactory performance of the EPS, particularly in summer and autumn 1993. In winter, cases of poor performance over Europe were associated with the occurrence of a split westerly flow with a blocking high and/or a cut-off low in the verifying analysis. Two cases are studied in detail, one having large ensemble dispersion, the other corresponding to a more predictable situation. The case studies are used to illustrate the range of ensemble products routinely disseminated to ECMWF Member States. These products include clusters df flow types, and probability fields of weather elements.},

The presence of the surface signal (1.3 Hz and higher) implies that propagation in the upper atmosphere occurred as an N-wave shock cone without the strong attenuation to which an acoustic wave or even a saw-toothed (shocked) wave of similar frequency would be subjected. The shock cone does not attenuate because energy is continually re-supplied along the shock cone from the vehicle and its plume acting as a piston. Calculated overpressures do not reduce to acoustic amplitudes until the wave is below 40 km where acoustic attenuation becomes negligible.},

abstract = {Using the Fourier Transform Spectrometer at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, we observed a spectrum of Mars at the P-branch of the strongest CH4 band at 3.3 $\mu$m with resolving power of 180,000 for the apodized spectrum. Summing up the spectral intervals at the expected positions of the 15 strongest Doppler-shifted martian lines, we detected the absorption by martian methane at a 3.7 sigma level which is exactly centered in the summed spectrum. The observed CH4 mixing ratio is 10 ± 3 ppb. Total photochemical loss of CH4 in the martian atmosphere is equal to 2.2 × 105 cm-2s-1, the CH4 lifetime is 340 years and methane should be uniformly mixed in the atmosphere. Heterogeneous loss of atmospheric methane is probably negligible, while the sink of CH4 during its diffusion through the regolith may be significant. There are no processes of CH4 formation in the atmosphere, so the photochemical loss must therefore be balanced by abiogenic and biogenic sources. Outgassing from Mars is weak, the latest volcanism is at least 10 million years old, and thermal emission imaging from the Mars Odyssey orbiter does not reveal any hot spots on Mars. Hydrothermal systems can hardly be warmer than the room temperature at which production of methane is very low in terrestrial waters. Therefore a significant production of hydrothermal and magmatic methane is not very likely on Mars. The calculated average production of CH4 by cometary impacts is 2{\%} of the methane loss. Production of methane by meteorites and interplanetary dust does not exceed 4{\%} of the methane loss. Methane cannot originate from an extinct biosphere, as in the case of "natural gas" on Earth, given the exceedingly low limits on organic matter set by the Viking landers and the dry recent history which has been extremely hostile to the macroscopic life needed to generate the gas. Therefore, methanogenesis by living subterranean organisms is a plausible explanation for this discovery. Our estimates of the biomass and its production using the measured CH4 abundance show that the martian biota may be extremely scarce and Mars may be generally sterile except for some oases. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Acoustic-gravity waves in the middle and upper atmosphere and long-range propagation of infrasound are strongly affected by air viscosity and thermal conductivity. To characterize the wave dissipation, it is typical to consider idealized environments, which admit plane-wave solutions. Here, an asymptotic approach is developed that relies instead on the assumption that spatial variations of environmental parameters are gradual. It is found that realistic assumptions about the atmosphere lead to rather different predictions for wave damping than do the plane-wave solutions. A modification to the Sutherland-Bass model of infrasound$\backslash$nabsorption is proposed.},

abstract = {The detection of methane on Mars has been interpreted as indicating that geochemical or biotic activities could persist on Mars today1. A number of different measurements of methane show evidence of transient, locally elevated methane concentrations and seasonal variations in background methane concentrations2–5. These measurements, however, are difficult to reconcile with our current understanding of the chemistry and physics of the Martian atmosphere6,7, which—given methane's lifetime of several centuries—predicts an even, well mixed distribution of methane1,6,8. Here we report highly sensitive measurements of the atmosphere of Mars in an attempt to detect methane, using the ACS and NOMAD instruments onboard the ESA-Roscosmos ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter from April to August 2018. We did not detect any methane over a range of latitudes in both hemispheres, obtaining an upper limit for methane of about 0.05 parts per billion by volume, which is 10 to 100 times lower than previously reported positive detections2,4. We suggest that reconciliation between the present findings and the background methane concentrations found in the Gale crater4 would require an unknown process that can rapidly remove or sequester methane from the lower atmosphere before it spreads globally.},

abstract = {Infrasound can propagate through the atmosphere over distances of hundreds to thousands of kilometers as a result of low absorption, depending on the state of the atmosphere. This property is utilized to record atmospheric explosions. Following the opening by the United Nations of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty for signature in 1996, the International Monitoring System (IMS) was designed in order to detect explosions with a minimum yield of one kiloton of TNT equivalent worldwide. Sixty IMS infrasound stations have since been recording corresponding pressure fluctuations of the order of 10−3 Pa to 10 Pa. This thesis reports on the determination of atmospheric waves, on different scales, from the barometric datasets of the IMS infrasound network. The focus was on the low-frequency part of the recorded spectrum of infrasonic waves, i.e., periods of 2 s to 100 s. The high precision of the barometric data and the worldwide distribution of the IMS stations were utilized to characterize a broad spectrum of atmospheric-dynamic phenomena. Dominant features include the thermal atmospheric tides, which are clearly distinguished at periods of 24 h, 12 h and 8 h in spectral analyses. The IMS infrasound network allowed the accurate characterization of the geographic and seasonal variability of this specific large-scale type of atmospheric gravity wave. In addition to these tides, spectral analysis of the differential pressure data also highlights a short-period range (2–10 s). This reflects coherent structures — microbaroms — that almost permanently produce infrasound detections worldwide. Microbaroms originate from the interaction of opposing ocean surface waves. The distribution of winds and temperature in the middle atmosphere determines the detectability of such signals. In weather models, however, the middle atmosphere is only represented to a limited extent. To quantify model uncertainties, temperature profiles in the altitude range of 20 km to 90 km were measured at infrasound station IS26 in Germany using a mobile lidar system. Combining a source model with an atmospheric attenuation relation allowed the transfer of these uncertainties into microbarom amplitudes for the first time. These explained up to 97 {\%} of the detections, in terms of their variability in origin and amplitude. Microbaroms and tidal waves differ in their restoring force — namely, pressure and buoyancy — due to their different scales. Atmospheric gravity waves reflect a broad spectral range between infrasound and the tides. A relation between orographic gravity waves and infrasonic mountainassociated waves (MAWs), of which the source generation mechanism has not yet been fully explored, was investigated here. Similarly to microbaroms, MAWs are coherent structures at periods of 10 s to 100 s that can propagate over distances of thousands of kilometers. The IMS data, for the first time, enabled a global analysis of MAWs. A cross-bearing method determined global source regions of this phenomenon on a monthly basis. It is shown that the MAWs correlate with tropospheric winds; however, the latter are not sufficient to explain the seasonal variability in MAW detections. Further possible processes being involved in the excitation of MAWs are discussed, including breaking orographic gravity waves. The comparison with gravity wave source regions, derived from satellite data, suggests that MAW source regions match those of orographic gravity waves, even when vertically propagating gravity waves are filtered due to a stratospheric wind minimum causing the waves to break. If this process, in future studies, turns out to induce the MAWs, their occurrence detected by the IMS infrasound network can allow monitoring orographic gravity wave activity globally.},

abstract = {The offshore extent of Antarctic katabatic winds exerts a strong control on the production of sea ice and the formation of polynyas. In this study, we make use of a combination of ground-based remotely sensed and meteorological measurements at Dumont d'Urville (DDU) station, satellite images, and simulations with the Weather Research and Forecasting Model to analyze a major katabatic wind event in Ad{\'{e}}lie Land. Once well developed over the slope of the ice sheet, the katabatic flow experiences an abrupt transition near the coastal edge consisting of a sharp increase in the boundary layer depth, a sudden decrease in wind speed, and a decrease in Froude number from 3.5 to 0.3. This so-called katabatic jump manifests as a turbulent “wall” of blowing snow in which updrafts exceed 5 m s −1 . The wall reaches heights of 1000 m and its horizontal extent along the coast is more than 400 km. By destabilizing the boundary layer downstream, the jump favors the trapping of a gravity wave train—with a horizontal wavelength of 10.5 km—that develops in a few hours. The trapped gravity waves exert a drag that considerably slows down the low-level outflow. Moreover, atmospheric rotors form below the first wave crests. The wind speed record measured at DDU in 2017 (58.5 m s −1 ) is due to the vertical advection of momentum by a rotor. A statistical analysis of observations at DDU reveals that katabatic jumps and low-level trapped gravity waves occur frequently over coastal Ad{\'{e}}lie Land. It emphasizes the important role of such phenomena in the coastal Antarctic dynamics.},

Aerodynamic velocities and density variations are computed from Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) accelerometer and thruster data during Tohoku-Oki tsunami propagation. High-frequency perturbations of these parameters are observed during three expected crossings of the tsunami-generated gravity waves by the GOCE satellite. From theoretical relations between air density and vertical and horizontal velocities inside the gravity wave, we demonstrate that the measured perturbations are consistent with a gravity wave generated by the tsunami and provide a way to estimate the propagation azimuth of the gravity wave. Moreover, because GOCE measurements can constrain the wave polarization, a marker (noted C3) of any gravity wave crossing by the GOCE satellite is constructed from correlation coefficients between the observed atmospheric state parameters. These observations validate a new observation tool of thermospheric gravity waves generated by tsunamis above the open ocean.},

The algorithm has been used to model signals from a large bolide that burst above a dense seismic network in the US Pacific Northwest on 19 February, 2008. We compare synthetics that have been computed using a G2S-ECMWF atmospheric model to signals recorded at the seismic networks located along an azimuth of 210° from the source; the results show that the timing and the range extent of the direct, stratospherically ducted and thermospherically ducted acoustic branches are accurately predicted. However, estimates of absorption obtained from standard attenuation models (Sutherland-Bass) predict much greater absorption for thermospheric returns at frequencies greater than 0.1 Hz than is observed. We conclude that either the standard absorption model for the thermospheric is incorrect, or that thermospheric returns undergo non-linear propagation at very high altitude. In the former case, a better understanding of atmospheric absorption at high altitudes is required; in the latter, a fully nonlinear numerical method is needed to test our hypothesis that higher frequency arrivals from the thermosphere result from nonlinear propagation at thermospheric altitudes.},

Am. 109, 1955 (2001)], a model of acoustic attenuation due to vibration-translation and vibration-vibration relaxation in multiple polyatomic gas mixtures was developed. In this paper, the model is improved by treating binary molecular collisions via fully pairwise vibrational transition probabilities. The sensitivity of the model to small variations in the Lennard-Jones parameters--collision diameter (sigma) and potential depth (epsilon)--is investigated for nitrogen-water-methane mixtures. For a N2(98.97{\%})-H2O(338 ppm)-CH4(1{\%}) test mixture, the transition probabilities and acoustic absorption curves are much more sensitive to sigma than they are to epsilon. Additionally, when the 1{\%} methane is replaced by nitrogen, the resulting mixture [N2(99.97{\%})-H2O(338 ppm)] becomes considerably more sensitive to changes of sigma(water). The current model minimizes the underprediction of the acoustic absorption peak magnitudes reported by S. G. Ejakov et al. [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 113, 1871 (2003)].},

We describe five analytical capabilities: rock classification, quantitative composition, depth profiling, context imaging, and passive spectroscopy. They serve as a toolbox to address most of the science questions at Gale crater. ChemCam consists of a Mast-Unit (laser, telescope, camera, and electronics) and a Body-Unit (spectrometers, digital processing unit, and optical demultiplexer), which are connected by an optical fiber and an electrical interface. We then report on the development, integration, and testing of the Mast-Unit, and summarize some key characteristics of ChemCam. This confirmed that nominal or better than nominal performances were achieved for critical parameters, in particular power density ({\textgreater}1 GW/cm 2). The analysis spot diameter varies from 350 $\mu$m at 2 m to 550 $\mu$m at 7 m distance. For remote imaging, the camera field of view is 20 mrad for 1024×1024 pixels. Field tests demonstrated that the resolution (∼90 $\mu$rad) made it possible to identify laser shots on a wide variety of images. This is sufficient for visualizing laser shot pits and textures of rocks and soils. An auto-exposure capability optimizes the dynamical range of the images. Dedicated hardware and software focus the telescope, with precision that is appropriate for the LIBS and imaging depths-of-field. The light emitted by the plasma is collected and sent to the Body-Unit via a 6 m optical fiber. The companion to this paper (Wiens et al. this issue) reports on the development of the Body-Unit, on the analysis of the emitted light, and on the good match between instrument performance and science specifications. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Impact investigations will be an important aspect of the InSight mission. One of the scientific goals of the mission is a measurement of the current impact rate at Mars. Impacts will additionally inform the major goal of investigating the interior structure of Mars. In this paper, we review the current state of knowledge about seismic signals from impacts on the Earth, Moon, and laboratory experiments. We describe the generalized physical models that can be used to explain these signals. A discussion of the appropriate source time function for impacts is presented, along with spectral characteristics including the cutoff frequency and its dependence on impact momentum. Estimates of the seismic efficiency (ratio between seismic and impact energies) vary widely. Our preferred value for the seismic efficiency at Mars is 5 × 10 − 4, which we recommend using until we can measure it during the InSight mission, when seismic moments are not used directly. Effects of the material properties at the impact point and at the seismometer location are considered. We also discuss the processes by which airbursts and acoustic waves emanate from bolides, and the feasibility of detecting such signals. We then consider the case of impacts on Mars. A review is given of the current knowledge of present-day cratering on Mars: the current impact rate, characteristics of those impactors such as velocity and directions, and the morphologies of the craters those impactors create. Several methods of scaling crater size to impact energy are presented. The Martian atmosphere, although thin, will cause fragmentation of impactors, with implications for the resulting seismic signals. We also benchmark several different seismic modeling codes to be used in analysis of impact detections, and those codes are used to explore the seismic amplitude of impact-induced signals as a function of distance from the impact site. We predict a measurement of the current impact flux will be possible within the timeframe of the prime mission (one Mars year) with the detection of ∼ a few to several tens of impacts. However, the error bars on these predictions are large. Specific to the InSight mission, we list discriminators of seismic signals from impacts that will be used to distinguish them from marsquakes. We describe the role of the InSight Impacts Science Theme Group during mission operations, including a plan for possible night-time meteor imaging. The impacts detected by these methods during the InSight mission will be used to improve interior structure models, measure the seismic efficiency, and calculate the size frequency distribution of current impacts.},

This code employs both the Green-Gauss and the Least Squares gradient approximations in order to achieve a spatial accuracy that is formally second order for both convection and diffusion. In this paper, the Method of Manufactured Solutions is employed to gen- erate exact solutions to the governing equations along with additional source terms. The exact solutions are then used to accurately evaluate the discretization error in the numerical solutions. The Manufactured Solutions approach is applied to the 2D inviscid Euler equations (both subsonic and supersonic), the 3D Euler equations (supersonic), and the 2D Navier-Stokes equations (both subsonic and supersonic). Through global discretization error analyses, the spatial order of accuracy is observed to be second order for all but one of the ten cases exam- ined.With regards to the other nine cases, a high degree of confidence is achieved that the Premo code is free from coding mistakes in the spatial discretization for uniform meshes.},

This handbook brings together in a single reference work a rich blend of information about the various types of cosmic threats that are posed to human civilization by asteroids, comets, bolides, meteors, solar flares and coronal mass ejections, cosmic radiation and other types of threats that are only recently beginning to be understood and studied, such as investigation of the "cracks" in the protective shield provided by the Van Allen belts and the geomagnetosphere, of matter-antimatter collisions, orbital debris and radiological or biological contamination. Some areas that are addressed involve areas about which there is a good deal of information that has been collected for many decades by multiple space missions run by many different space agencies, observatories and scientific researchers. Other areas involving research and studies that have only recently gotten underway are discussed by some of the world's foremost experts in each of these areas, who provide up-to-date and scientifically verifiable information. Although much of the work in these various areas have been conducted by space agencies, an expanding range of work is also being carried out by observatories, by universities and other research centers, and even by private foundations and professional organizations. The purpose of this work is thus several-fold: to include the latest information and most systematic research from around the world in a single reference work; to note where there are significant gaps in knowledge where new research, spacecraft, observatories, or other initiatives are needed to fill in critical missing information; and to give the best possible information about preventative actions that might be taken against cosmic threats and identify various alternative strategies that are now under way or planned to cope with these various threats.},

abstract = {To model infrasonic propagation, two areas must be adequately addressed. First, the environment must encompass a domain spanning from the ground to the lower reaches of the thermosphere, and its properties must be resolved at a scale comparable to the acoustic wavelengths of interest. Second, the relevant fundamental physics that influence the wave propagation must be captured in the numerical models that are applied. To address these challenges, a large amount of work has been completed by researchers in fields spanning from traditional acoustics to upper atmospheric physics. In this chapter, this body of work is reviewed with an emphasis on its applicability to the modeling and interpretation of infrasonic observations. Global climatological models have largely been replaced in current infrasound modeling practice by atmospheric specifications that combine output from numerical weather prediction models for the lower atmosphere with empirical models for the upper atmosphere. Recently developed specifications incorporate higher-resolution, regional or mesoscale weather analysis products in order to improve fidelity below altitudes of 50 km. Specifications that utilize a terrain-following coordinate system, including high-resolution topography, enable the incorporation of additional physical effects. These specifications are unable to resolve all fine-scale stochastic phenomena, e.g., atmospheric irregularities smaller than the model resolution, fine-scale structures at altitudes above 50 km, and gravity wave fluctuations. In particular, gravity waves are of interest because their spatial scales are of the same order as infrasonic wavelengths. Because atmospheric fine-scale structure is inherently turbulent, spectral formulations are used to capture the energy distribution across space-time scales relevant to infrasound and to generate representative realizations of variable fields. The fundamental physical processes that affect infrasound, much like those of higher frequency acoustics, include refraction, diffraction, scattering, absorption, dispersion, and terrain. In addition, nonlinear effects can become significant near the source and at high altitudes. Several numerical approaches have been used for modeling infrasonic propagation often based on analogous models for underwater and outdoor sound propagation. They can be loosely classified under the headings of geometric (ray tracing, Gaussian beam, tau-p), continuous wave (parabolic equation or PE), full-wave (normal mode, finite-difference time domain, time-domain PE), and nonlinear (e.g., NPE). A good introductory source to the underlying computational aspects is (Jensen F, Kuperman W, Porter M, Schmidt H (1994) Computational ocean acoustics. AIP Press, New York). (Although this reference is primarily intended for ocean acoustics, many of the models carry over to the atmosphere and the presentation is superb.) A general overview of the propagation models is presented here with their corresponding strengths and weaknesses highlighted in the context of infrasonic studies. Also included are examples of modeling studies using high-resolution atmospheric specifications. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

@article{Liu1976,
abstract = {The concept of a relaxation spectrum is used to compute the absorption and dispersion of a linear anelastic solid. The Boltzmann after-effect equation is solved for a solid having a linear relationship between stress and strain and their first time derivatives, the 'standard linear solid', and having a distribution of relaxation times. The distribution function is chosen to give a nearly constant Q over the seismic frequency range. Both discrete and continuous relaxation spectra are considered. The resulting linear solid has a broad absorption band which can be interpreted in terms of a super-position of absorption peaks of individual relaxation mechanisms. The accompanying phase and group velocity dispersion imply that one cannot directly compare body wave, surface wave, and free oscillation data or laboratory and seismic data without correcting for absorption. The neces-sary formalism for making these corrections is given. In the constant Q regions the correction is the same as that implied in the theories of Futter-man, Lomnitz, Strick and Kolsky. 1 Introduction It is usually assumed in seismological studies that elastic moduli and seismic wave velocities are independent of frequency. This is equivalent to assuming that the Earth is perfectly elastic or that seismic frequencies are far away from any absorption bands. However, the fact that seismic waves attenuate with distance and that free oscillations decay with time indicate that the Earth is not an ideal elastic body. The observation that Q-', the specific dissipation function or seismic quality factor, is roughly constant from the body wave to the free oscil-lation band indiates that Q-' cannot satisfy the w or w-'-dependence required by physical mechanisms of attenuation at frequencies remote from the characteristic frequency of the attenuation mechanism. For example, the observation that ScS waves of periods of 10-30 s have approximately the same Q as toroidal oscillations of periods in excess of 1000 s (e.g. provides a strong constraint on the dissipation spectrum and the associated dispersion, even if Q is not precisely independent of frequency. The consequences of dispersions are that one cannot directly compare body wave, surface wave, and free oscillation data or compare laboratory ultrasonic and shock wave data with seismic data, unless corrections are made for phase velocity dispersion arising from anelasticity. The importance of phase velocity disper-sion due to anelasticity has been discussed by Lomnitz (1957), Jeffreys (1965), Carpenter {\&} Davies (1966), Futterman (1962), Strick (1967), Lamb (1962) and Randall (1976). Although body wave data are often corrected for dispersion (e.g. Carpenter 1967; Helm-berger 1973) using Futterman's theory (Futterman 1962), the effect of physical dispersion is usually ignored in surface wave and free oscillation interpretations. The reason, possibly, is that there are arbitrary assumptions and physical shortcomings in most of the theories that have been put forward to explain the near constancy of Q and the resulting required phase velocity dispersion. In this paper we show from general physical considerations, that the phase velocity dispersion due to anelasticity is important. This affects inversion of surface wave and free oscillation data, inferences from body wave spectra, comparison of body wave and normal mode earth models, discussions of the base line problems in travel times and oceanic-continental differences and use of laboratory high pressure, high tem-perature data to infer the composition of the Earth.},

Correlation of attenuation with lithology is good, considering the resolution limits of the surveys. One of the surveys was performed in West Texas, and the other four were carried out in the Gulf Coast area. The total number of recording depths in each survey varied from 31 to 208, with downhole recordings taken every 10 or 20 ft over key stratigraphic zones. In all five surveys, a monitor geophone was placed near the well to check for source consistency. Our procedure for measuring attenuation involved constructing the spectral ratio between each downhole pulse and one particular reference pulse.

abstract = {The upper bound of 50 parts per trillion by volume for Mars methane above 5 km established by the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, substantially lower than the 410 parts per trillion by volume average measured overnight by the Curiosity Rover, places a strong constraint on the daytime methane flux at the Gale crater. We propose that these measurements may be largely reconciled by the inhibition of mixing near the surface overnight, whereby methane emitted from the subsurface accumulates within meters of the surface before being mixed below detection limits at dawn. A model of this scenario allows the first precise calculation of microseepage fluxes at Gale to be derived, consistent with a constant 1.5 × 10−10 kg{\textperiodcentered}m−2{\textperiodcentered}sol−1 (5.4 × 10−5 tonnes{\textperiodcentered}km−2{\textperiodcentered}year−1) source at depth. Under this scenario, only 2.7 × 104 km2 of Mars's surface may be emitting methane, unless a fast destruction mechanism exists.},

abstract = {The plasma wave instrument on the Pioneer Venus Orbiter frequently detects strong and impulsive low-frequency signals when the spacecraft traverses the nightside ionosphere near periapsis. These particular noise bursts appear only when the local magnetic field is strong and steady and when the field is oriented to point down to the ionosphere thus; the signals have all characteristics of lightning whistlers. We have tried to identify lightning sources between the cloud layers and the planet itself by tracing rays along the B-field from the Orbiter down toward the surface. An extensive data set, consisting of measurements through Orbit 1185, strongly indicates a clustering of lightning sources near the Beta and Phoebe Regios, with an additional significant cluster near the Atla Regio at the eastern edge of Aphrodite Terra. These results suggest that there are localized lightning sources at or near the planetary surface.},

Tabulations from the Handbook for MAP 16 are the primary guide for the lower atmosphere and are supplemented by historical rocket and incoherent scatter data in the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere. Low-order spherical harmonics and Fourier series are used to describe the major variations throughout the atmosphere including latitude, annual, semiannual, and simplified local time and longitude variations. While month to month details cannot be completely represented, lower atmosphere temperature data are fit to an overall standard deviation of 3 K and pressure to 2{\%}. Comparison with rocket and other data indicates that the model represents current knowledge of the climatological average reasonably well, although there is some conflict as to details near the mesopause.},

abstract = {An experiment was conducted in the Lesponne Valley (central French Pyrenees) to record the sounds that frequently accompany earthquakes in this region. Seismic and acoustic signals of a short-period seismometer and a condenser microphone were continuously monitored for ten months. During this period, four small (ML {\textless}2.8) earthquakes provided clear audio recordings at short epicentral distances ({\textless}20 km). Sounds associated not only to the direct P transmission, but also SV-to- P conversion into the atmosphere are identified, thus confirming former hypotheses  formulated by Hill et al. (1976). Unambiguous quantitative constraints on the seismic-to-acoustic conversion are provided by the computation of transmission coefficients. The dominant audio frequencies are recorded in the 5- to 60-Hz band, that  is, at the boundary between sounds and infrasounds, and at the lower bound of human audibility. High-frequency infrasounds (about 8 Hz) are interpreted as the transmission to the atmosphere of Rayleigh waves induced locally by a thin soil layer.},

abstract = {The Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package HP3 for the InSight mission will attempt the first measurement of the planetary heat flow of Mars. The data will be taken at the InSight landing site in Elysium planitia (136 ∘E, 5 ∘N) and the uncertainty of the measurement aimed for shall be better than ±5 mW m−2. The package consists of a mechanical hammering device called the “Mole” for penetrating into the regolith, an instrumented tether which the Mole pulls into the ground, a fixed radiometer to determine the surface brightness temperature and an electronic box. The Mole and the tether are housed in a support structure before being deployed. The tether is equipped with 14 platinum resistance temperature sensors to measure temperature differences with a 1-$\sigma$ uncertainty of 6.5 mK. Depth is determined by a tether length measurement device that monitors the amount of tether extracted from the support structure and a tiltmeter that measures the angle of the Mole axis to the local gravity vector. The Mole includes temperature sensors and heaters to measure the regolith thermal conductivity to better than 3.5{\%} (1-$\sigma$) using the Mole as a modified line heat source. The Mole is planned to advance at least 3 m—sufficiently deep to reduce errors from daily surface temperature forcings—and up to 5 m into the martian regolith. After landing, HP3 will be deployed onto the martian surface by a robotic arm after choosing an instrument placement site that minimizes disturbances from shadows caused by the lander and the seismometer. The Mole will then execute hammering cycles, advancing 50 cm into the subsurface at a time, followed by a cooldown period of at least 48 h to allow heat built up during hammering to dissipate. After an equilibrated thermal state has been reached, a thermal conductivity measurement is executed for 24 h. This cycle is repeated until the final depth of 5 m is reached or further progress becomes impossible. The subsequent monitoring phase consists of hourly temperature measurements and lasts until the end of the mission. Model calculations show that the duration of temperature measurement required to sufficiently reduce the error introduced by annual surface temperature forcings is 0.6 martian years for a final depth of 3 m and 0.1 martian years for the target depth of 5 m.},

abstract = {The nonlinear propagation of low-frequency acoustic waves through the turbulent fluctuations induced by breaking mountain gravity waves is investigated via 2-D numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations, to understand the effects of atmospheric dynamics on ground-based infrasound measurements. Emphasis is placed on acoustic signals of frequency around 0.1 Hz, traveling through tens-of-kilometers-scale gravity waves and subkilometer-scale turbulence. The sensitivity of the infrasonic phases to small-scale fluctuations is found to depend on the altitudes through which they are refracted toward the Earth. For the considered cases, the dynamics in the stratosphere impact the refracting acoustic waves to a greater extent than those in the thermosphere. This work clearly demonstrates the need for accurate descriptions of the effects of atmospheric dynamics on acoustic propagation, such as here captured by the full set of fluid dynamic equations, as well as of the subsequent effects on measured signals.},

abstract = {Aprevious paper introduced generalized characteristic boundary conditions for computational aeroacoustics (CAA), especially in the focus of far-field nonreflecting conditions. Strict wall boundary conditions are now de- veloped on the basis of the generalized characteristics. True multidimensionality of the characteristic relations is guaranteed by maintaining entire terms of governing equations, which had been approximated virtually by local one-dimensional inviscid relations during the past two decades. Treating the transverse and viscous terms as source terms in the characteristic relations leads to an exact and simple formalism of wall boundary conditions. The formalism does not include any kind of extrapolation or assumption. The proposed inviscid and viscous wall boundary conditions are applied to typical CAA problems for verifying numerical accuracy in actual implemen- tations. The computations are performed on nonorthogonal grids to exhibit the effect of multidimensionality on the solutions in acoustic fields. It is shown that the present results are in good agreement with analytic estimations and experimental data. This demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed wall boundary conditions for further practical CAA applications.},

abstract = {Tilt from atmospheric loading has long been known to be the major source of long-period horizontal seismic noise. We try to quantify these effects for seismic data from the Black Forest Observatory (BFO), which is known to be a very quiet station. Experimental transfer functions between local barometric pressure and horizontal seismic noise are estimated for two long time-series by standard methods. Two simple analytical physical models are developed: the local deformation model (LDM) and the acoustic-gravity wave model (TWM). Subsequently these models, with only two free parameters are fit using least squares to the observed seismic noise for time-series of widely differing lengths. The results are variable, sometimes rather dramatic variance reductions are obtained and sometimes the reduction is hardly significant. The method produces the best results when barometrically induced noise is high. The resulting admittances for the LDM are compared to finite element calculations. Since the methods are simple and can result in conspicuous reductions in noise we provide one more reason for installing barometers at even the best broad-band seismic stations. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2007 RAS.},

abstract = {Density, porosity, and compressional wave velocity have been measured in the laboratory for 7S samples representing the major rock units of Victoria Land and the adjacent sea floor. Granitic and metamorphic rocks from the Late Precambrian-Early Paleozoic basement show significant differences in saturated density (2' 66 and 2' 77 Mg m") and velocity (4{\textperiodcentered} 7 and 5' 3 km s"). Low rank metasedimentary and sedimentary rocks from north Victoria Land give intermediate values. Field-measured velocities in granite are O: 9 km s" higher than laboratory velocities for surface granitic rocks, but are in the same range as velocities from granite cored below 156 mat DVDP Site 6. The basement rocks are overlain by the Beacon Supergroup, a flat-lying sandstone sequence up to 2 km thick and of Devonian to Triassic age. The physical properties of Beacon samples show a wide range (density 2{\textperiodcentered} 22-2{\textperiodcentered}61 Mg m"; porosity 6-21{\%}; velocity 2{\textperiodcentered} 2-4'4 km s"); there appears to be no consistent relationship between these properties and lithology or stratigraphic position. The Beacon Supergroup is intruded by extensive sills of Jurassic dolerite 30 to 300 m thick, and these are much more consistent in density and velocity (2'90Mg m{\textperiodcentered} 3 and 5{\textperiodcentered}skm s"). Field measurement, however, indicates a velocity 1{\textperiodcentered} 1 km s" higher at depth. Because no other major known rock type in the region has a higher velocity, Beacon and older rocks beneath the uppermost major dolerite sill will be inaccessible by seismic refraction techniques. Early Cenozoic sediments are known mainly from erratics around McMurdo Sound, but have recently been found at DSDP Site 270, 400 km to the east. They have a shallow marine character and are typically calcareous. The range in density (2{\textperiodcentered}40-2{\textperiodcentered} 71 Mg rn") and velocity (3. 0-4'2 km s") overlaps considerably with the Beacon samples. The widespread Late Cenozoic sediments beneath the Ross Sea, which are largely pebbly mudstone of glacial origin, are significantly different (1. 68-2 {\textperiodcentered}12 Mg rn" and 1{\textperiodcentered} 6-2'6 km s") from the older pre-glacial strata. The McMurdo Volcanic Group includes Late Cenozoic basaltic and intermediate rocks, which at DVDP Site 3 have densities and velocities of 2{\textperiodcentered} 77 and 2{\textperiodcentered} 21 Mg m", and 4{\textperiodcentered} 6 and 2'6 km s" for a flow-dominated and a pyroclastic sequence respectively. These data are consistent with Robinson's suggestion of a 2 km-thick layer of volcanic ash overlying basalt beneath the sea floor south and west of Hut Point. However, farther out in McMurdo Sound the velocity gradient beneath the sea floor is steep, and the upper kilometre of strata there is believed to include both Early and Late Cenozoic sedimentary rocks.},

Seismic waveforms through air-to-ground coupling processes were also detected at 6 sites, showing a one-to-one correspondence to infrasound waves at all simultaneous observation sites. Audible sound up to 1 kHz was recorded at one site with a distance of 67.8 km. The mother spacecraft was fragmented from 75 km down to 38 km with a few explosive enhancements of emissions. A persistent train of HAYABUSA re-entry was confirmed at an altitude range of between 92 km down to 82 km for about 3 minutes. Light curves of 136 fragmented parts of the spacecraft were analyzed in detail based on video observations taken at multiple ground sites, being classified into three types of fragmentations, i.e., melting, explosive, and re-fragmented types. In a comparison between infrasonic waves and video-image analyses, regarding the generation of sonic-boom type shock waves by hypersonically moving artificial meteors, both the sample return capsule and fragmented parts of the mother spacecraft, at an altitude of 40 ± 1 km were confirmed with a one-to-one correspondence with each other.},

It is proven that the proposed condition was shown to be free of reflection for single wave propagation. Two severe tests were used to demonstrate the applicability of the open boundary condition: (i) the collapsing bubble, a dynamic event which excites many different internal gravity waves. The results show minimum distortion. (ii) The spatially growing K-H instability. This test differs from the previous one in that the only waves excited are those corresponding to the maximum unstable wavelengths. In this case, the maximum amplitude is reached at the open boundary. As it has been shown, the open boundary condition (2.2) produces minimum distortion. {\textcopyright} 1976.},

Spatial differencing in horizontal directions is performed by the Fourier method, whereas vertical derivatives are carried out by a Chebychev method that allows for the incorporation of boundary conditions into the numerical scheme. The method is based on the velocity-stress formulation. The implementation of surface topography is done by mapping a rectangular grid onto a curved grid. Boundary conditions are applied by means of characteristic variables. The study of surface effects of seismic wave propagation in the presence of surface topography is important, since nonray effects such as diffractions and scattering at rough surfaces must be considered. Several examples show this. The 3-D modeling alogrithm can serve as a tool for understanding these phenomena since it computes the full wavefield.},

abstract = {The central Italy Apennines were rocket in 2016 by the strongest earthquakes of the past 35 years. Two main shocks (Mw 6.2 and Mw 6.6) between the end of August and October caused the death of almost 300 people, and the destruction of 50 villages and small towns scattered along 40 km in the hanging wall of the N165° striking Mount Vettore fault system, that is, the structure responsible for the earthquakes. The 24 August southern earthquake, besides causing all the casualties, razed to the ground the small medieval town of Amatrice and dozens of hamlets around it. The 30 October main shock crushed definitely all the villages of the whole epicentral area (up to 11 intensity degree), extending northward the level of destruction and inducing heavy damage even to the 30 km far Camerino town. The survey of the macroseismic effects started the same day of the first main shock and continued during the whole seismic sequence, even during and after the strong earthquakes at the end of October, allowing the definition of a detailed picture of the damage distribution, day by day. Here we present the results of the final survey in terms of Mercalli-Cancani-Sieberg intensity, which account for the cumulative effects of the whole 2016 sequence (465 intensity data points, besides 435 related to the 24 August and 54 to the 26 October events, respectively). The distribution of the highest intensity data points evidenced the lack of any possible overlap between the 2016 earthquakes and the strongest earthquakes of the region, making this sequence a unique case in the seismic history of Italy. In turn, the cross matching with published paleoseismic data provided some interesting insights concerning the seismogenic behavior of the Mount Vettore fault in comparison with other active normal faults of the region.},

abstract = {The catastrophic seismic events of the last decades push forward the necessity to explore new techniques for source estimation, oceanic tsunami tracking, as well as tsunami warning systems. Early observations of the Rayleigh wave signature in the ionosphere by Doppler sounder were able to measure lithospheric properties, sounding the atmosphere at 200 km of altitude. After the Sumatra event (26 December 2004), the successful tsunami detection by altimeters validates the possibility of tsunami detection by ionospheric sounding. Today, the catastrophic tsunamigenic earthquake in Tohoku (11 March 2011) strongly affirms the potential of iono- spheric sounding to visualize the vertical displacement of the ground and ocean: the Japanese GPS network, GEONET, imaged the source extent 8 min after the rupture; it also visualizes the radiation pattern and Rayleigh waves over the entire Japan, including the oceanic region overlooking the rupture; in the far field, the airglow camera located in Hawaii showed the internal gravity wave forced by the tsunami propagating in a zone of 180 ×180 km2 around the island. The ionospheric sounding potential of 2D visualization could extend the pre- sent vision of seismology. This work highlights the actual capability and the potential improvement suggested by ionospheric seismology.},

abstract = {This paper reviews recent progress toward understanding the dynamics of the middle atmosphere in the framework of the Atmospheric Dynamics Research InfraStructure in Europe (ARISE) initiative. The middle atmosphere, integrating the stratosphere and mesosphere, is a crucial region which influences tropospheric weather and climate. Enhancing the understanding of middle atmosphere dynamics requires improved measurement of the propagation and breaking of planetary and gravity waves originating in the lowest levels of the atmosphere. Inter-comparison studies have shown large discrepancies between observations and models, especially during unresolved disturbances such as sudden stratospheric warmings for which model accuracy is poorer due to a lack of observational constraints. Correctly predicting the variability of the middle atmosphere can lead to improvements in tropospheric weather forecasts on timescales of weeks to season. The ARISE project integrates different station networks providing observations from ground to the lower thermosphere, including the infrasound system developed for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty verification, the Lidar Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change, complementary meteor radars, wind radiometers, ionospheric sounders and satellites. This paper presents several examples which show how multi-instrument observations can provide a better description of the vertical dynamics structure of the middle atmosphere, especially during large disturbances such as gravity waves activity and stratospheric warming events. The paper then demonstrates the interest of ARISE data in data assimilation for weather forecasting and re-analyzes the determination of dynamics evolution with climate change and the monitoring of atmospheric extreme events which have an atmospheric signature, such as thunderstorms or volcanic eruptions.},

@article{Montabone2015,
abstract = {We have produced a multiannual climatology of airborne dust from martian year 24-31 using multiple datasets of retrieved or estimated column optical depths. The datasets are based on observations of the martian atmosphere from April 1999 to July 2013 made by different orbiting instruments: the Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) aboard Mars Global Surveyor, the Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) aboard Mars Odyssey, and the Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) aboard Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). The procedure we have adopted consists of gridding the available retrievals of column dust optical depth (CDOD) from TES and THEMIS nadir observations, as well as the estimates of this quantity from MCS limb observations. Our gridding method calculates averages and uncertainties on a regularly spaced spatio-temporal grid, using an iterative procedure that is weighted in space, time, and retrieval quality. The lack of observations at certain times and locations introduces missing grid points in the maps, which therefore may result in irregularly gridded (i.e. incomplete) fields. In order to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the resulting gridded maps, we compare with independent observations of CDOD by PanCam cameras and Mini-TES spectrometers aboard the Mars Exploration Rovers "Spirit" and "Opportunity", by the Surface Stereo Imager aboard the Phoenix lander, and by the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars aboard MRO. We have statistically analyzed the irregularly gridded maps to provide an overview of the dust climatology on Mars over eight years, specifically in relation to its interseasonal and interannual variability, in addition to provide a basis for instrument intercomparison. Finally, we have produced regularly gridded maps of CDOD by spatially interpolating the irregularly gridded maps using a kriging method. These complete maps are used as dust scenarios in the Mars Climate Database (MCD) version 5, and are useful in many modeling applications. The two datasets for the eight available martian years are publicly available and distributed with open access on the MCD website.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2018. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. The mechanical coupling between solid planets and their atmospheres enables seismically induced acoustic waves to propagate in the atmosphere. We numerically simulate this coupled system for two application cases: active seismic experiments (ASEs) and passive seismic experiments. A recent ASE (Krishnamoorthy et al., 2018, https://doi.org/10.1002/2018GL077481) observed the infrasonic signals produced by a seismic hammer. To measure the sensitivity of observations to seismic parameters, we attempt to reproduce the results from this experiment at short range by considering a realistic unconsolidated subsurface and an idealized rock-solid subsurface. At long range, we investigate the influence of the source by using two focal mechanisms. We found surface waves generate an infrasonic plane head wave in the ASE case of the rock-solid material. For the passive seismic experiments, the amplitude of atmospheric infrasound generated by seismic surface waves is investigated in detail. Despite some limitations, the simulations suggest that balloon measurement of seismically induced infrasound might help to constrain ground properties.},

Initial analysis of only radial velocities indicates that each balloon was blown westward about 11,500 kilometers (8,000 kilometers on the night side) by zonal winds with a mean speed of about 70 meters per second. Excursions of the data from a model of constant zonal velocity were generally less than 3 meters per second; however, a much larger variation was evident near the end of the flight of the second balloon. Consistent systematic trends in the residuals for both balloons indicate the possibility of a solar-fixed atmospheric feature. Rapid variations in balloon velocity were often detected within a single transmission (330 seconds); however, they may represent not only atmospheric motions but also self-induced aerodynamic motions of the balloon.},

abstract = {Direct numerical simulations of the two-dimensional unsteady compressible Navier-Stokes equations are performed to study the acoustic field generated by an infrasonic source in a realistic atmosphere. Some of the main phenomena affecting the propagation of infrasonic waves at large distances from the source are investigated. The effects of thermal and wind-related refraction on the signals recorded at ground level are highlighted, with particular emphasis on the phase shift induced by the presence of caustics in the acoustic field. Nonlinear waveform steepening associated with harmonic generation, and period lengthening, both of which are typical of large source amplitudes, are illustrated, and the importance of thermoviscous absorption in the upper atmosphere is clearly demonstrated. The role of diffraction in the shadow zone, around caustics and at stratospheric altitudes is also pointed out. The Navier-Stokes equations are solved using high-order finite-differences and a Runge-Kutta time integration me...},

abstract = {Homogeneous wave guide theory is used to derive dispersion curves, vertical pressure distributions, and synthetic barograms for atmospheric waves. A complicated mode structure is found involving both gravity and acoustic waves. Various models of the atmosphere are studied to explore seasonal and geographic effects on pulse propagation. The influence of different zones in the atmosphere on the character of the barograms is studied. It is found that the first arriving waves are controlled by the properties of the lower atmospheric channel. Comparison of theoretical results and experimental data from large thermonuclear explosions is made in the time and frequency domains, and the following conclusions are reached: (1) The major features on barograms are due to dispersion; (2) superposition of several modes is needed to explain observed features; (3) scatter of data outside the range permitted by extreme atmospheric models shows the influence of winds for A 1; wind effects and higher modes are less important for A 2 waves. A discussion is included on atmospheric terminations and how these affect dispersion curves.},

abstract = {Various parabolic equations for advected acoustic waves have been derived based on the assumptions of small Mach number and narrow propagation angles, which are of limited validity in atmospheric acoustics. A parabolic equation solution that does not require these assumptions is derived in the weak shear limit, which is appropriate for frequencies of about 0.1 Hz and above for atmospheric acoustics. When the variables are scaled appropriately in this limit, terms involving derivatives of the sound speed, density, and wind speed are small but can have significant cumulative effects. To obtain a solution that is valid at large distances from the source, it is necessary to account for linear terms in the first derivatives of these quantities [A. D. Pierce, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 87, 2292-2299 (1990)]. This approach is used to obtain a scalar wave equation for advected waves. Since this equation contains two depth operators that do not commute with each other, it does not readily factor into outgoing and incoming solutions. An approximate factorization is obtained that is correct to first order in the commutator of the depth operators. {\textcopyright} 2002 Acoustical Society of America.},

abstract = {Clear atmospheric pressure changes associated with the 2003 Tokachi-Oki, Japan, earthquake with Mw 8.3 were recorded with the microbarographs distributed in Japan. The pressure change starts at the arrival of seismic waves and reaches its maximum amplitude at the arrival of Rayleigh waves, suggesting that the observed pressure change was driven by the ground motion of seismic waves passing by the site. We computed the seismic-to-pressure transfer function (i.e., the spectral ratio of the pressure change to the vertical ground motion velocity) for periods between 10 to 50 s from the co-located barograph and seismograph records. Comparison of the observed transfer function with the theoretical one including the finite frequency and wavelength effects for a gravitationally stratified isothermal atmosphere confirms that the observed amplitude and phase of the pressure change are explained by the acoustic coupling between the atmosphere and the ground just beneath the sensors.},

abstract = {The acoustic ray tracing relations are extended by the inclusion of auxiliary parameters describing variations in the spatial ray coordinates and eikonal vector due to changes in the initial conditions. Computation of these parameters allows one to define the geometric spreading factor along individual ray paths and assists in identification of caustic surfaces so that phase shifts can be easily identified. A method is developed leveraging the auxiliary parameters to identify propagation paths connecting specific source-receiver geometries, termed eigenrays. The newly introduced method is found to be highly efficient in cases where propagation is non-planar due to horizontal variations in the propagation medium or the presence of cross winds. The eigenray method is utilized in analysis of infrasonic signals produced by a multi-stage sounding rocket launch with promising results for applications of tracking aeroacoustic sources in the atmosphere and specifically to analysis of motor performance during dyna...},

@article{Heavens2019,
abstract = {Deep convection, as used in meteorology, refers to the rapid ascent of air parcels in Earth's troposphere driven by the buoyancy generated by phase change in water. Deep convection undergirds some of Earth's most important and violent weather phenomena and is responsible for many aspects of the observed distribution of energy, momentum, and constituents (particularly water) in Earth's atmosphere. Deep convection driven by buoyancy generated by the radiative heating of atmospheric dust may be similarly important in the atmosphere of Mars but lacks a systematic description. Here we propose a comprehensive framework for this phenomenon of dusty deep convection (DDC) that is supported by energetic calculations and observations of the vertical dust distribution and exemplary dusty deep convective structures within local, regional, and global dust storm activity. In this framework, DDC is distinct from a spectrum of weaker dusty convective activity because DDC originates from preexisting or concurrently forming mesoscale circulations that generate high surface dust fluxes, oppose large-scale horizontal advective–diffusive processes, and are thus able to maintain higher dust concentrations than typically simulated. DDC takes two distinctive forms. Mesoscale circulations that form near Mars's highest volcanoes in dust storms of all scales can transport dust to the base of the upper atmosphere in as little as 2 h. In the second distinctive form, mesoscale circulations at low elevations within regional and global dust storm activity generate freely convecting streamers of dust that are sheared into the middle atmosphere over the diurnal cycle.},

abstract = {The mechanical properties of any substance are essential facts to understand its behaviour and make the maximum use of the particular substance. Rocks are indeed an important substance, as they are of significant use in the energy industry, specifically for fossil fuels and geothermal energy. Attenuation of seismic waves is a non-destructive technique to investigate mechanical properties of reservoir rocks under different conditions. The attenuation characteristics of five different rock types, siltstone, shale, Australian sandstone, Indian sandstone and granite, were investigated in the laboratory using ultrasonic and acoustic emission instruments in a frequency range of 0.1–1 MHz. The pulse transmission technique and spectral ratios were used to calculate the attenuation coefficient ($\alpha$) and quality factor (Q) values for the five selected rock types for both primary (P) and secondary (S) waves, relative to the reference steel sample. For all the rock types, the attenuation coefficient was linearly proportional to the frequency of both the P and S waves. Interestingly, the attenuation coefficient of granite is more than 22{\%} higher than that of siltstone, sandstone and shale for both P and S waves. The P and S wave velocities were calculated based on their recorded travel time, and these velocities were then used to calculate the dynamic mechanical properties including elastic modulus (E), bulk modulus (K), shear modulus ($\mu$) and Poisson's ratio ($\nu$). The P and S wave velocities for the selected rock types varied in the ranges of 2.43–4.61 km s−1 and 1.43–2.41 km h−1, respectively. Furthermore, it was observed that the P wave velocity was always greater than the S wave velocity, and this confirmed the first arrival of P waves to the sensor. According to the experimental results, the dynamic E value is generally higher than the static E value obtained by unconfined compressive strength tests.},

abstract = {Propagation modeling based on existing semiempirical atmospheric models roughly explains seasonal changes in infrasonic observables but underestimates their fluctuations. The discrepancies between observations and predictions are probably due to the lack of precision in available upper wind models. Here we propose a continuous infrasound monitoring of active volcanoes as a remote sensing method of the upper atmosphere. A refined inversion procedure has been developed for adjusting the vertical structure of the wind in the upper stratosphere and mesosphere. The results of the inversion show that the speed of the mesospheric wind jet in the original wind model is significantly underestimated and the strong wind region in the stratosphere should be extended to the lower thermosphere. In this regard, it is expected that a global infrasound tomography would greatly enhance our understanding of the dynamics of the upper atmosphere in a region where routine measurements still remain illusive.},

Observations become increasingly difficult within and below the global cloud deck ({\textless}50 km altitude), where strong absorption greatly limits the available investigative spectrum to a few infrared windows and the radio range. Here we report radio-sounding results from the first Venus Express Radio Science (VeRa) occultation season.

abstract = {FOLLOWING the US and USSR atmospheric test series in 1954−1962, numerous microbarograph records1−8 of air waves generated by nuclear bomb tests were published. Previous theoretical interpretations7,9 of such waveforms have required some explicit knowledge of the average atmospheric temperature and wind profiles above the path connecting source to microbarograph. Such profiles are never sufficiently well known and vary from point to point, and as seemingly small changes in the profiles cause relatively large changes in the waveforms, it would seem to be difficult to estimate the explosion energy yield to even order of magnitude accuracy from such records. Recently, however, in a further account of this work to be published elsewhere, we have succeeded in deriving an approximate theoretical relationship between certain waveform features and energy yield which is insensitive to changes in atmospheric structure. This relationship is given by where E is energy release, p FPT is the first peak to trough pressure amplitude (see Fig. 1), r e is radius of the Earth, r is the great circle distance from burst point to observation point, H s is a lower atmosphere scale height, c is a representative sound speed, and T 1,2 is the time interval between first and second peaks. The purpose of the present communication is to describe the extent to which the above relation agrees with the existing available data.},

The Lorentz force and Joule heating are discussed in the existing literature as primary sources producing infrasound waves in the frequency range 0.1-0.01Hz associated with the auroral electrojet. The results are consistent with original ideas of Swift (1973) and demonstrate that the synchronization of the speed of auroral arc and phase speed of the acoustic wave in the electrojet volume is an important condition for generation of magnitudes and frequency contents of infrasonic waves observable on the ground. The reported modeling also allows accurate quantitative reproduction of previously observed complex infrasonic waveforms including direct shock and reflected shockwaves, which are refracted back to the earth by the thermosphere. {\textcopyright} 2012.

With a simple quake model, an upper limit of infrasonic adiabatic temperature and density perturbations above the source is estimated. Then, we demonstrate that the temperature increase due to high altitude acoustic energy dissipation above a quake is large enough to be measured by remote sensing methods.

The study regions are divided into grid blocks. We use a longitudinal study design, seeking associations between seismicity and wastewater injection volume along time series within each grid block. In each grid block, we find the maximum likelihood estimate for a model parameter that relates induced seismicity hazard to total volume of wastewater injected each year. To assess significance, we compute likelihood ratio test statistics in each grid block and each state, California and Oklahoma. Resampling with permutation and random temporal offset of injection data is used to estimate p values from the likelihood ratio statistics. We focus on assessing whether observed associations between injection and seismicity occur more often than would be expected by chance; we do not attempt to quantify the overall incidence of induced seismicity. The study is designed so that, under reasonable assumptions, the associations can be formally interpreted as demonstrating causality. Wastewater disposal is associated with other activities that can induce seismicity, such as reservoir depletion. Therefore, our results should be interpreted as finding seismicity induced by wastewater disposal and all other associated activities. In Oklahoma, the analysis finds with extremely high confidence that seismicity associated with wastewater disposal has occurred. In California, the analysis finds moderate evidence that seismicity associated with wastewater disposal has occurred, but the result is not strong enough to be conclusive.},

Early recordings showed that, at low frequencies, there is relatively little intrinsic attenuation, facilitating the detection and characterization of large events over great ranges (e.g., Landau and Lifshitz 1959). Infrasound was used to locate enemy artillery in WWI. Infrasound was used as a monitoring tool during the early proliferation of nuclear weapon technologies after WWII when nuclear tests were routinely conducted in the atmosphere. In 1963, the Limited Test Ban Treaty was signed by most nations, and nuclear testing generally went underground.

abstract = {A shock capturing strategy for higher order Discontinuous Galerkin approximations of scalar conservation laws is presented. We show how the original explicit artificial viscosity methods proposed over fifty years ago for finite volume methods, can be used very effectively in the context of high order approximations. Rather than relying on the dissipation inherent in Discontinuous Galerkin approximations, we add an artificial viscosity term which is aimed at eliminating the high frequencies in the solution, thus eliminating Gibbs-type oscillations. We note that the amount of viscosity required for stability is determined by the resolution of the approximating space and therefore decreases with the order of the approximating polynomial. Unlike classical finite volume artificial viscosity methods, where the shock is spread over several computational cells, we show that the proposed approach is capable of capturing the shock as a sharp, but smooth profile, which is typically contained within one element. The method is complemented with a shock detection algorithm which is based on the rate of decay of the expansion coefficients of the solution when this is expressed in a hierarchical orthonormal basis. For the Euler equations, we consider and discuss the performance of several forms of the artificial viscosity term.},

Donc augmenter le pas de temps seulement dans le fluide ne changera pas la condition CFL et la simulation num{\'{e}}rique pourra s'effectuer sans risquer l'explosion de la solution pour cause d'instabilit{\'{e}} du sch{\'{e}}ma num{\'{e}}rique.

abstract = {The variational principle of Hamilton is applied to develop an analytical formulation to describe the volume viscosity in fluids. The procedure described here differs from those used in the past in that a dissipative process is represented by the chemical affinity and progress variable sometimes called ``order parameter'' of a reacting species. These state variables appear in the variational integral in two places: first, in the expression for the internal energy, and second, in a subsidiary condition accounting for the conservation of the reacting species. As a result of the variational procedure, two dissipative terms appear in the Navier-Stokes equation. The first is the traditional volume viscosity term, proportional to the dilatational component of velocity; the second term is proportional to the material time derivative of the pressure gradient. Values of the respective volume viscosity coefficients are determined by applying the resulting volume-viscous Navier-Stokes equation to the case of acoustical propagation and then comparing expressions for the dispersion and absorption of sound. The formulation includes the special case of equilibration of the translational degrees of freedom. As examples, values are tabulated for dry and humid air, argon, and sea water.},

abstract = {This paper presents the application of an alternative waveguide finite element method (WFE) using standard FE-code for the computation of dispersion curves in fluid filled elastic pipes. Only one element is needed in longitudinal direction of the pipe in the FE model, which includes structural-acoustic interaction by a full coupling interface. After rearranging the dynamic stiffness matrix of the segment model in transfer matrix form, a periodicity condition is applied leading to an eigenvalue problem. Here, eigenvectors correspond to wave modes and eigenvalues are a function of the complex wavenumber. From the eigenpairs, phase velocities and group velocities of branches are computed as well as sound power transmission. Instead of solving the eigenvalue problem for each frequency separately, an eigenpath analysis is presented in order to track dispersion curves through the frequency band of interest. The numerical results are compared to results from an analytical model of a thin walled fluid-filled shell. The method allows periodic wave guides with any cross section to be analyzed while employing standard FE discretization. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The amplitude attenuation and phase dispersion for Love and Rayleigh waves in the period range 50 to 300 sec is determined from two earthquakes by digital techniques. A distribution of Q, or anelasticity, is determined for the upper mantle which satisfies the amplitude decay data for Love and Rayleigh waves and which is consistent with available body wave data. An argument is made for a longitudinal wave Q of about 2.4 to 2.6 times the Q for shear waves. This implies that very small losses are involved in pure compression compared to the losses in shear. This is an argument against the importance of certain mechanisms, such as thermoelastic losses, in the mantle. The Q for shear waves in the upper 400 km of the mantle seems to vary from about 50 to about 150. The Q for mantle Rayleigh waves is greater than the Q for mantle Love waves, both theoretically and experimentally. However, it is predicted that QR becomes less than QL at some period shorter than 50 sec, the crossover period being diagnostic of the thickness of the ‘Q crust' or lithosphere.},

@article{Spiga2018a,
abstract = {In November 2018, for the first time a dedicated geophysical station, the InSight lander, will be deployed on the surface of Mars. Along with the two main geophysical packages, the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS) and the Heat-Flow and Physical Properties Package (HP3), the InSight lander holds a highly sensitive pressure sensor (PS) and the Temperature and Winds for InSight (TWINS) instrument, both of which (along with the InSight FluxGate (IFG) Magnetometer) form the Auxiliary Sensor Payload Suite (APSS). Associated with the RADiometer (RAD) instrument which will measure the sur- face brightness temperature, and the Instrument Deployment Camera (IDC) which will be used to quantify atmospheric opacity, this will make InSight capable to act as a meteoro- logical station at the surface of Mars. While probing the internal structure of Mars is the primary scientific goal of the mission, atmospheric science remains a key science objective for InSight. InSight has the potential to provide a more continuous and higher-frequency record of pressure, air temperature and winds at the surface of Mars than previous in situ missions. In the paper, key results from multiscale meteorological modeling, from Global Climate Models to Large-Eddy Simulations, are described as a reference for future stud- ies based on the InSight measurements during operations. We summarize the capabilities of InSight for atmospheric observations, from profiling during Entry, Descent and Landing to surface measurements (pressure, temperature, winds, angular momentum), and the plans for how InSight's sensors will be used during operations, as well as possible synergies with orbital observations. In a dedicated section, we describe the seismic impact of atmospheric phenomena (from the point of view of both “noise” to be decorrelated from the seismic signal and “signal” to provide information on atmospheric processes). We discuss in this framework Planetary Boundary Layer turbulence, with a focus on convective vortices and dust devils, gravity waves (with idealized modeling), and large-scale circulations. Our paper also presents possible new, exploratory, studies with the InSight instrumentation: surface layer scaling and exploration of the Monin-Obukhov model, aeolian surface changes and saltation / lifing studies, and monitoring of secular pressure changes. The InSight mission will be instrumental in broadening the knowledge of the Martian atmosphere, with a unique set of measurements from the surface of Mars.},

abstract = {We report a Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations study of carbon dioxide in hydrated sodium montmorillonite, including thermodynamical, structural, and dynamical properties. In order to simulate the behavior of a clay caprock in contact with a CO2 reservoir, we consider clays in equilibrium with H2O−CO2 mixtures under conditions close to relevant ones for geological storage, namely a temperature T = 348 K, and pressures P = 25 and 125 bar, and under which two bulk phases coexist: H2O-rich liquid on the one hand and CO2-rich gas (P = 25 bar) or supercritical fluid (P = 125 bar) on the other hand. We first use grand canonical MC simulations to determine the number of stable states in clay, their composition, and the corresponding equilibrium interlayer distances. The vertical, horizontal, and radial distribution functions of the confined mixture, subsequently obtained using molecular dynamics, reveal some structural feature induced by the presence of CO2. Finally, the simulations indicate that carbon dioxide considerably influences the diffusion of mobile species in clays. We discuss these results by comparing them with those obtained for the bulk mixtures, as well as for Na-montmorillonite in equilibrium with a pure water reservoir water at the same temperature and pressure.},

This study presents a finite-difference modeling tool tailored for acoustic-gravity wave applications that takes into account the effect of background winds, atten-uation phenomena (including relaxation effects specific to carbon dioxide atmo-spheres) and wave amplification by exponential density decrease with height. The simulation tool is implemented in 2D Cartesian coordinates and first validated by comparison with analytical solutions for benchmark problems. It is then applied to surface explosions simulating meteor impacts on Mars in various Martian atmo-spheric conditions inferred from global climate models. The acoustic wave travel times are validated by comparison with 2D ray tracing in a windy atmosphere. Our simulations predict that acoustic waves generated by impacts can refract back to the surface on wind ducts at high altitude. In addition, due to the strong nighttime near-surface temperature gradient on Mars, the acoustic waves are trapped in a waveguide close to the surface, which allows a night-side detection of impacts at large distances in Mars plains. Such theoretical predictions are directly applicable to future measurements by the INSIGHT NASA Discovery mission.},

@article{Toigo2012,
abstract = {We investigate the sensitivity of the circulation and thermal structure of the martian atmosphere to numerical model resolution in a general circulation model (GCM) using the martian implementation (MarsWRF) of the planetWRF atmospheric model. We provide a description of the MarsWRF GCM and use it to study the global atmosphere at horizontal resolutions from 7.5° × 9° to 0.5° × 0.5°, encompassing the range from standard Mars GCMs to global mesoscale modeling. We find that while most of the gross-scale features of the circulation (the rough location of jets, the qualitative thermal structure, and the major large-scale features of the surface level winds) are insensitive to horizontal resolution over this range, several major features of the circulation are sensitive in detail. The northern winter polar circulation shows the greatest sensitivity, showing a continuous transition from a smooth polar winter jet at low resolution, to a distinct vertically "split" jet as resolution increases. The separation of the lower and middle atmosphere polar jet occurs at roughly 10. Pa, with the split jet structure developing in concert with the intensification of meridional jets at roughly 10. Pa and above 0.1. Pa. These meridional jets appear to represent the separation of lower and middle atmosphere mean overturning circulations (with the former being consistent with the usual concept of the "Hadley cell"). Further, the transition in polar jet structure is more sensitive to changes in zonal than meridional horizontal resolution, suggesting that representation of small-scale wave-mean flow interactions is more important than fine-scale representation of the meridional thermal gradient across the polar front. Increasing the horizontal resolution improves the match between the modeled thermal structure and the Mars Climate Sounder retrievals for northern winter high latitudes. While increased horizontal resolution also improves the simulation of the northern high latitudes at equinox, even the lowest model resolution considered here appears to do a good job for the southern winter and southern equinoctial pole (although in detail some discrepancies remain). These results suggest that studies of the northern winter jet (e.g., transient waves and cyclogenesis) will be more sensitive to global model resolution that those of the south (e.g., the confining dynamics of the southern polar vortex relevant to studies of argon transport). For surface winds, the major effect of increased horizontal resolution is in the superposition of circulations forced by local-scale topography upon the large-scale surface wind patterns. While passive predictions of dust lifting are generally insensitive to model horizontal resolution when no lifting threshold is considered, increasing the stress threshold produces significantly more lifting in higher resolution simulations with the generation of finer-scale, higher-stress winds due primarily to better-resolved topography. Considering the positive feedbacks expected for radiatively active dust lifting, we expect this bias to increase when such feedbacks are permitted. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

The observations show that during windy intervals and in the period range 20--100 s there is a strong correlation between local atmospheric pressure changes and the noise recorded by a vertical seismograph located on the surface. In contrast, over the same range of periods there is no correlation between the seismic noise recorded in the mine and local atmospheric pressure changes except during the passage of acoustic waves. It is shown that the noise in this pass band is not due to the buoyant response of the seismograph, but is caused by the motion of the Earth responding to atmospheric pressure changes.},

abstract = {Typical infrasound propagation paths extend into the middle and upper atmosphere before turning back to Earth near the stratopause or lower thermosphere. The modelling of infrasound propagation is complicated by several factors. Propagation of sound in the atmosphere becomes increasingly non-linear as the mean density of the atmosphere decreases. As a consequence, infrasound propagation, which can follow paths high into the atmosphere before turning back to earth, is intrinsically non-linear. Further, attenuation of sound also increases as the mean density of the atmosphere decreases. Linear propagation modelling predicts severe attenuation along thermospheric paths, in contradiction with observation. Finally, the currently available atmospheric specifications necessarily involve temporal and spatial interpolations which can lead to the omission of atmospheric fluctuations to which infrasound propagation is sensitive. In this paper, existing methods for modelling weakly non-linear propagation are extended to account for the moving inhomogeneous medium and are then used to study the modelling of waveforms produced by impulsive events. It is found that there is a substantial interplay between signal attenuation and non-linear distortion. Waveform steepening and shocking in the middle and upper atmosphere associated with higher harmonic generation is moderated by attenuation while attenuation in the upper atmosphere is moderated by period lengthening associated with low frequency generation. The modelling of observed data is then considered. Using traveltime data, corrections to the atmospheric specifications are obtained. The predicted waveform evolution, modelled using the developed non-linear propagation model and the corrected atmospheric specifications, matches the observations well.},

abstract = {The Horizontal Wind Model (HWM) has been updated in the thermosphere with new observations and formulation changes. These new data are ground-based 630 nm Fabry-Perot Interferometer (FPI) measurements in the equatorial and polar regions, as well as cross-track winds from the Gravity Field and Steady State Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) satellite. The GOCE wind observations provide valuable wind data in the twilight regions. The ground-based FPI measurements fill latitudinal data gaps in the prior observational database. Construction of this reference model also provides the opportunity to compare these new measurements. The resulting update (HWM14) provides an improved time-dependent, observationally based, global empirical specification of the upper atmospheric general circulation patterns and migrating tides. In basic agreement with existing accepted theoretical knowledge of the thermosphere general circulation, additional calculations indicate that the empirical wind specifications are self-consistent with climatological ionosphere plasma distribution and electric field patterns.},

abstract = {The current deployment of the EarthScope Transportable Array (TA) in Alaska affords an unprecedented opportunity to study explosive volcanic eruptions using a relatively dense regional seismo-acoustic network. Infrasound monitoring has demonstrated utility for the remote ({\textgreater} 250 km range) detection and characterization of volcanic explosions, but previous studies have used relatively sparse regional or global networks. Seventy explosive events from the locally unmonitored Bogoslof volcano (2016–2017) provide a unique validation dataset to examine the ability of the TA and other regional networks to detect and locate remote explosive volcanic eruptions in Alaska. With a simple envelope-based reverse time migration (RTM) technique, we are able to detect and locate more than 72{\%} of the 61 Bogoslof infrasound events detected by the Alaska Volcano Observatory. Notably, RTM using only sparse regional infrasound arrays produces similar results to when incorporating the extensive single-sensor TA network, likely due to favorable signal-to-noise ratios, seasonal propagation conditions, and source-receiver geometries. Our implementation also detects and locates explosive eruptions from Cleveland volcano, Alaska, and Bezymianny volcano, Kamchatka, as well as infrasound from non-volcanic events such as earthquakes. We characterize the success of the RTM algorithm and associated parameter choices using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, event detection rates, and location accuracy. Our methods are useful for explosive volcanic and non-volcanic event detection and localization using real-time data, and for scanning continuous waveform data archives.},

Synthetic tests have been performed to check the capability of the method, which returns the input test data when the source–array distances are not greater than two or three times the array aperture. For this distance range the method furnishes an estimate of the apparent velocity and the epicentral coordinates of the source. For more distant sources the method becomes equivalent to that based on the planar-wave approximation, which gives an estimate of the backazimuth to the source and the apparent velocity. The method has been applied to seismic data recorded at the active volcano located at Deception Island, Antarctica. 35 volcanic long-period events occurring in a small swarm were selected. Results show that the epicentres are close to the array (between 0.4 and 2 km) and aligned in a SW direction, in agreement with one of the main directions of the fracture system of Deception volcano.},

abstract = {Ultra-low frequency acoustic waves called "acoustic gravity waves" or "infrasounds" are theoretically expected to resonate between the ground and the thermosphere. This resonance is a very important phenomenon causing the coupling of the solid Earth, neutral atmosphere, and ionospheric plasma. This acoustic resonance, however, has not been confirmed by direct observations. In this study, atmospheric perturbations on the ground and ionospheric disturbances were observed and compared with each other to confirm the existence of resonance. Atmospheric perturbations were observed with a barometer, and ionospheric disturbances were observed using the HF Doppler method. An end point of resonance is in the ionosphere, where conductivity is high and the dynamo effect occurs. Thus, geomagnetic observation is also useful, so the geomagnetic data were compared with other data. Power spectral density was calculated and averaged for each month. Peaks appeared at the theoretically expected resonance frequencies in the pressure and HF Doppler data. The frequencies of the peaks varied with the seasons. This is probably because the vertical temperature profile of the atmosphere varies with the seasons, as does the reflection height of infrasounds. These results indicate that acoustic resonance occurs frequently.},

A perturbation expansion for the treatment of attenuation, valid for stratified media with background flow, is derived as well. Comparisons are carried out between the proposed algorithm and a modal algorithm assuming an effective sound speed, including a real data case study. The comparisons show that the effective sound speed approximation overestimates the effect of horizontal wind on sound propagation, leading to errors in traveltime, propagation path, trace velocity, and absorption.

abstract = {Atmospheric gravity waves have been a subject of intense research activity in recent years because of their myriad effects and their major contributions to atmo- spheric circulation, structure, and variability. Apart from occasionally strong lower-atmospheric effects, the major wave in?uences occur in the middle atmosphere, be- tween 10 and 110 km altitudes because of decreasing density and increasing wave amplitudes with altitude. Theoretical, numerical, and observational studies have advanced our understanding of gravity waves on many fronts since the review by Fritts [1984a]; the present review will focus on these more recent contributions. Progress includes a better appreciation of gravity wave sources and characteristics, the evolution of the gravity wave spectrum with altitude and with variations of wind and stability, the character and implications of observed climatologies, and the wave interaction and instability processes that constrain wave amplitudes and spectral shape. Recent studies have also expanded dramatically our understanding of gravity wave in?uences on the large-scale circulation and the thermal and constituent structures of the middle atmosphere. These advances have led to a number of parameterizations of gravity wave effects which are enabling ever more realistic de- scriptions of gravity wave forcing in large-scale models. There remain, nevertheless, a number of areas in which further progress is needed in re?ning our understanding of and our ability to describe and predict gravity wave in?uences in the middle atmosphere. Our view of these unknowns and needs is also offered.},

abstract = {An unusually long (at least two hours) seismic wave train having periods of about 230 sec was recorded at many worldwide seismic stations during the major eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines on June 15, 1991. This wave train exhibits two sharp spectral peaks at 228 and 270 sec. The group velocity, phase velocity, and the particle motion of this wave train indicate that it is a Rayleigh wave. The most probable excitation mechanism is acoustic coupling of atmospheric oscillations that were set off by continuous thermal energy flux from the volcano. The two spectral peaks correspond to the characteristic periods of acoustic and gravity modes of the Earth's atmosphere. The magnitude of the vertical single force equivalent to the acoustic coupling is 1.6×1017 dynes over a frequency band of 0.003 to 0.01 Hz. The results suggest the possibility of using acoustically coupled Rayleigh waves for detection, characterization and quantification of volcanic eruptions. Acoustic coupling of the atmosphere and the solid Earth provides a unique seismic source with long duration.},

abstract = {The InSight mission to Mars landed within Homestead hollow on an Early Amazonian lava plain. The hollow is a 27-m-diameter, 0.3-m-deep quasi-circular depression that shares morphologic and sedimentologic characteristics to degraded impact craters. Unlike the intercrater plains outside of the hollow, the interior lacks cobbles and is dominated by loose sand, granules, and pebbles. Fresher craters near the landing site exhibit meter-scale bedforms in their ejecta and on their floors due to sediment trapping. The sedimentology of the interior fill of Homestead hollow suggests similar trapping. The hollow falls along a morphologic continuum that requires low rates of rim degradation and fill. Crater degradation rates (rim erosion plus filling) in the landing site decline nonlinearly through time from 10−2 to 10−4 m/Myr as craters evolve to a hollow-like form. Rim erosion rates are lower initially, at 10−3 m/Myr, but converge with degradation rates to 10−4 m/Myr. This implies that while filling plays an important role soon after crater formation, it is limited in later stages. Crater statistics indicate that the bulk of the fill occurred in the first {\~{}}50 Myr for Homestead hollow. The estimated maximum age of the hollow is {\~{}}400 to 700 Myr. This requires near-zero fill aggradation and long-term soil stability for the bulk of the crater's history. Fill stability manifests in Homestead hollow as a {\~{}}5- to 10-cm-thick duricrust, formed by exchanges of atmospheric water vapor with soil. The estimated degradation in the hollow requires {\~{}}2 to 3 m of sedimentary fill beneath the lander.},

abstract = {A theory analogous to the Longuet-Higgins theory on the generation of microseisms explains the generation of microbaroms by standing water waves associated with marine storms. The spectral characteristics and the amplitude order-of-magnitude of microbaroms that are predicted by this theory agree well with observations. The theory is based on the oscillations of the centre of gravity of the air above the Ocean surface on which the standing waves appear (or of the water below, to explain microseisms). These oscillations are of twice the ocean wave frequency and thereby explain the observed frequency-doubling common to both microbaroms and microseisms. The theory is expanded by statistical methods to predict the microbarom-generating effect of more realistic ocean waves, whose phases vary randomly over the Ocean surface. In addition, the effect of the widespread source on microbarom coherence and resolvability at the receiving array is discussed. 1.},

abstract = {In high speed flows the interactions of shock waves with turbulent boundary layers are important design considerations because of the complex flowfields resulting in increased adverse pressure gradients, skin friction and temperatures. Unsteadiness and three-dimensional flowfield structure are also characteristic of shock wave turbulent boundary layer interactions. Such physical phenomena require sophisticated numerical schemes in the solution of governing equations. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to introduce an accurate and efficient approach - the Mixed Explicit-Implicit Generalized Galerkin Spectral Element Method (MEI-GG-SEM) with Legendre polynomial spectral elements in which flowfield dependent implicitness parameters provide automatically adequate computational requirements for compressible and incompressible flows or high speed and low speed flows. This is in contrast to the traditional approach in which all-speed-regime analysis requires a separate hyperbolic-elliptic pressure equation for pressure correction if the flow becomes incompressible. In the MEI-GG-SEM scheme, mesh refinements are carried out adaptively until shock waves are resolved, followed then by the adaptive increase of Legendre polynomial degrees until turbulence microscales are resolved, in which the traditional turbulence modeling is no longer required, aimed toward direct numerical simulation. In order to demonstrate the validity of the theory and numerical procedure, two-dimensional flat plate and compression corner high speed flows are investigated, followed by a three-dimensional sharp leading edged fin for swept shock wave turbulent boundary layer interactions. Comparisons of the present study with experimental measurements and other numerical studies show favorable agreement.},

abstract = {Unsplit convolutional perfectly matched layers (CPML) for the velocity and stress formulation of the seismic wave equation are classically computed based on a second-order finite-difference time scheme. However it is often of interest to increase the order of the time-stepping scheme in order to increase the accuracy of the algorithm. This is important for instance in the case of very long simulations. We study how to define and implement a new unsplit non-convolutional PML called the Auxiliary Differential Equation PML (ADE-PML), based on a high-order Runge-Kutta time-stepping scheme and optimized at grazing incidence. We demonstrate that when a second-order time-stepping scheme is used the convolutional PML can be derived from that more general non-convolutional ADE-PML formulation, but that this new approach can be generalized to high-order schemes in time, which implies that it can be made more accurate. We also show that the ADE-PML formulation is numerically stable up to 100,000 time steps.},

abstract = {Although it contains less water vapour than Earth's atmosphere, the Martian atmosphere hosts clouds. These clouds, composed of water-ice particles, influence the global transport of water vapour and the seasonal variations of ice deposits. However, the influence of water-ice clouds on local weather is unclear: it is thought that Martian clouds are devoid of moist convective motions, and snow precipitation occurs only by the slow sedimentation of individual particles. Here we present numerical simulations of the meteorology in Martian cloudy regions that demonstrate that localized convective snowstorms can occur on Mars. We show that such snowstorms-or ice microbursts-can explain deep night-time mixing layers detected from orbit and precipitation signatures detected below water-ice clouds by the Phoenix lander. In our simulations, convective snowstorms occur only during the Martian night, and result from atmospheric instability due to radiative cooling of water-ice cloud particles. This triggers strong convective plumes within and below clouds, with fast snow precipitation resulting from the vigorous descending currents. Night-time convection in Martian water-ice clouds and the associated snow precipitation lead to transport of water both above and below the mixing layers, and thus would affect Mars' water cycle past and present, especially under the high-obliquity conditions associated with a more intense water cycle.},

abstract = {Acoustic coupling between solid Earth and atmosphere has been observed since the 1960s, first from ground-based seismic, pressure, and ionospheric sensors and since 20 years with various satel-lite measurements, including with global positioning system (GPS) satellites. This coupling leads to the excitation of the Rayleigh surface waves by local atmospheric sources such as large natural explosions from volcanoes, meteor atmospheric air-bursts, or artificial explosions. It contributes also in the continuous excitation of Rayleigh waves and associated normal modes by atmospheric winds and pressure fluctuations. The same coupling allows the observation of Rayleigh waves in the thermosphere most of the time through ionospheric monitoring with Doppler sounders or GPS. The authors review briefly in this paper observations made on Earth and describe the general frame of the theory enabling the computation of Rayleigh waves for models of telluric planets with atmo-sphere. The authors then focus on Mars and Venus and give in both cases the atmospheric proper-ties of the Rayleigh normal modes and associated surface waves compared to Earth. The authors then conclude on the observation perspectives especially for Rayleigh waves excited by atmo-spheric sources on Mars and for remote ionospheric observations of Rayleigh waves excited by quakes on Venus.},

abstract = {Near-surface attenuation and site effects are investigated using the seismograms of 17 local earthquakes recorded at depths of 0, 0.3, 1.5, 2.5, and 2.9 km in the Cajon Pass borehole, southern California. The borehole penetrates 500 m of Miocene sandstone and then crystalline, granitic basement rock. Previous estimates of site response have been limited to shallower holes, where the surface reflection interferes with the upgoing direct wave, and the deepest sensor is not below the severe near-surface effects, in bedrock. Spectral ratios of the direct P and S waves for each earthquake between the different recording levels are well modeled with frequency-independent Q and amplification. At the borehole, QP ∼ 27 ± 8, and QS ∼ 21 ± 7 in the upper 2.9 km, increasing from QP ∼26 and QS ∼15 in the upper 300 m to QP ∼133 and QS ∼47 between 1.5 and 3 km. One event was also recorded at a surface granite site, less than 1.5 km from the wellhead. Comparison of the 2.9-km recording with that at this granite site gives QP ∼50 and QS ∼23. The similarity of these values with those of previous studies at a wide range of sites suggests that Q is very low in the near surface, independent of rock type. Near-surface amplification appears considerably more site dependent. At the wellhead, the amplifications at 1 Hz of the direct P and S waves are 12 ± 7 and 13 ± 7, respectively. These values include the free-surface effect and are in reasonable agreement with the impedance contrast from the borehole logs. At the granite site, amplification of both P and S waves is less than four; direct-wave amplification at the wellhead is therefore at least three times that of the granite site. The spectra of the direct and coda waves of the one earthquake recorded at both the wellhead and granite sites are compared with the corresponding 2.9-km recording. Coda-wave amplification is in good agreement with the direct wave at the rock site, but at the borehole, the coda-wave amplification factor overestimates the direct-wave amplification by a factor of 3.},

@article{Xie2014,
abstract = {In recent years, the application of time-domain adjoint methods to improve large, complex underground tomographic models at the regional scale has led to new challenges for the numerical simulation of forward or adjoint elastic wave propagation problems. An important challenge is to design an efficient infinite-domain truncation method suitable for accurately truncating an infinite domain governed by the second-order elastic wave equation written in displacement and computed based on a finite-element (FE) method. In this paper, we make several steps towards this goal. First, we make the 2-D convolution formulation of the complex-frequency-shifted unsplit-field perfectly matched layer (CFS-UPML) derived in previous work more flexible by providing a new treatment to analytically remove singular parameters in the formulation. We also extend this new formulation to 3-D. Furthermore, we derive the auxiliary differential equation (ADE) form of CFS-UPML, which allows for extension to higher order time schemes and is easier to implement. Secondly, we rigorously derive the CFS-UPML formulation for time-domain adjoint elastic wave problems, which to our knowledge has never been done before. Thirdly, in the case of classical low-order FE methods, we show numerically that we achieve long-time stability for both forward and adjoint problems both for the convolution and the ADE formulations. In the case of higher order Legendre spectral-element methods, we show that weak numerical instabilities can appear in both formulations, in particular if very small mesh elements are present inside the absorbing layer, but we explain how these instabilities can be delayed as much as needed by using a stretching factor to reach numerical stability in practice for applications. Fourthly, in the case of adjoint problems with perfectly matched absorbing layers we introduce a computationally efficient boundary storage strategy by saving information along the interface between the CFS-UPML and the main domain only, thus avoiding the need to solve a backward wave propagation problem inside the CFS-UPML, which is known to be highly ill-posed. Finally, by providing several examples we show numerically that our formulation is efficient at absorbing acoustic waves for normal to near-grazing incident body waves as well as surface waves.},

abstract = {Summary Of the waves which propagate in the atmosphere at acoustic velocity in the period range from 10 to 100 s, one type has been classified by triangulation as arising principally from mountainous regions. These signals were first described as ‘northwesters' or ‘310 ers' by the NBS Geoacoustics Group under R. K. Cook at Washington, D.C., from the predominant direction of arrival. Subsequent operation of an observatory at Boulder, Colorado by Vernon Goerke gave a source region by triangulation in the Pacific Northwest, primarily in Montana and Alberta. Installations of observatories at College, Alaska (Wilson) and Pullman, Washington-Moscow, Idaho (Craine and Thomas) enlarged the data base available, and triangulation showed the principal source areas to be along the coast of British Columbia and in the inland Rocky Mountains of the British Columbia-Alberta border. This paper discusses the presently known characteristics of this class of infrasonic waves, locates the triangulation areas, reviews selected events, and suggests that certain of these waves are produced as aerodynamic sound. The paper shows a correlation between the 500 mb jet stream velocity and direction in these mountainous regions, and the detection of these atmospheric pressure waves.},

The detected infrasound followed the trend of these observations. A model of sound radiated from vortex systems predicts frequencies in the range observed.

abstract = {Solving open-region elastodynamic problems implies that the infinite region exterior to the radiating/scattering object has to be truncated with some type of artificial boundary such that the computational domain becomes limited. Hence, a boundary condition that absorbs elastic waves leaving the computational domain independent of direction and frequency needs to be introduced. Such a condition serves, as far as possible, as a transparent boundary that should yield perfect transmission of the scattered/radiated field and thereby minimize the non-physical reflections from the boundary. During the last 35 years, several absorbing boundary condition (ABC) techniques have been developed in the endeavor to complete this task [1–9]. Formulations based on non-local conditions (i.e. an exact representation of the infinite medium) are difficult to implement and cannot manage arbitrary material heterogeneity, whereas their local peers only exhibit good performance under tailored circumstances (frequency dependent, specific angles of incidence)},

abstract = {A new perfectly matched layer (PML) formulation for the time domain finite element method is described and tested for Maxwell's equations. In particular, we focus on the time integration scheme which is based on Galerkin's method with a temporally piecewise linear expansion of the electric field. The time stepping scheme is constructed by forming a linear combination of exact and trapezoidal integration applied to the temporal weak form, which reduces to the well-known Newmark scheme in the case without PML. Extensive numerical tests on scattering from infinitely long metal cylinders in two dimensions show good accuracy and no signs of instabilities. For a circular cylinder, the proposed scheme indicates the expected second order convergence toward the analytic solution and gives less than 2{\%} root-mean-square error in the bistatic radar cross section (RCS) for resolutions with more than 10 points per wavelength. An ogival cylinder, which has sharp comers supporting field singularities, shows similar accuracy in the monostatic RCS. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The formulation results in a mass matrix that is diagonal by construction. The scheme exhibits high accuracy for a 2-D test case with known analytical solution. The method is robust in the case of strong topography at the fluid-solid interface and is a good alternative to classical techniques, such as finite differencing.},

abstract = {The atmospheric pressure fluctuations on Mars induce an elastic response in the ground that creates a ground tilt, detectable as a seismic signal on the InSight seismometer SEIS. The seismic pressure noise is modeled using Large Eddy Simulations of the wind and surface pressure at the InSight landing site and a Green's function ground deformation approach that is subsequently validated via a detailed comparison with two other methods based on Sorrells' theory (Sorrels 1971; Sorrels et al. 1971). The horizontal acceleration as a result of the ground tilt due to the LES turbulence-induced pressure fluctuations are found to be typically {\~{}}2 - 40 nm/s{\^{}}2 in amplitude, whereas the direct horizontal acceleration is two orders of magnitude smaller and is thus negligible in comparison. The vertical accelerations are found to be {\~{}}0.1 - 6 nm/s{\^{}}2 in amplitude. We show that under calm conditions, a single-pressure measurement is representative of the large-scale pressure field (to a distance of several kilometers), particularly in the prevailing wind direction. However, during windy conditions, small-scale turbulence results in a reduced correlation between the pressure signals, and the single-pressure measurement becomes less representative of the pressure field. Nonetheless, the correlation between the seismic signal and the pressure signal is found to be higher for the windiest period because the seismic pressure noise reflects the atmospheric structure close to the seismometer. In the same way that we reduce the atmospheric seismic signal by making use of a pressure sensor that is part of the InSight APSS (Auxiliary Payload Sensor Suite), we also the use the synthetic noise data obtained from the LES pressure field to demonstrate a decorrelation strategy.},

@article{Ivanov2013,
abstract = {Completion of a global geological map of Venus has provided documentation of the relative age relationships, spatial distribution, and topographic configuration of the major geologic units and permitted us to address several important problems concerning the volcanic history of Venus. We use these data to: 1) assess the stratigraphic position of volcanic units and landforms, 2) determine their relationship with structure and tectonics, 3) identify changes in volcanic style, flux and activity with time, and 4) determine the topographic configuration and stratigraphic position of volcanism in relation to the evolution of long-wavelength topography. Tectonic Associations The scale and abundance of tectonic structures helps to divide the spectrum of volcanic units into two main groups: 1) volcanic units where tectonic structures played a subordinate role and 2) tectonized units/terrains, in which tectonic structures are the primary features relative to volcanism. Sequence of Volcanism Volcanic units embay the majority of the tectonized terrains and a sharp transition from heavily deformed units to mildly tectonized volcanic plains indicates that a tectonically driven regime dominated the earlier stages of the geologic history of Venus. This was followed by a regime of predominantly volcanic activity during the middle stages of observed geologic history. The latter stage is characterized by a volcano-tectonic resurfacing regime. Volcanic Units Regional plains are the most widespread volcanic unit and are likely to have an average thickness of the order of 400-500 m. Buried and partly buried 'ghost' craters, seen commonly on Mars and Mercury, are very rare, strongly suggesting that the previous cratering record was erased prior to formation of regional plains. The vast plains show a very small number of obviously flooded craters, which strongly suggests massive volcanic flooding over large provinces. In contrast to regional plains, the stratigraphically younger and much less widespread lobate plains embay ∼50{\%} of craters interacting with them. This suggests that emplacement of lobate plains was more in equilibrium with the growing population of impact craters. Relations with topography There are two major groups of topographic highs on Venus: 1) plateau-like, tessera-bearing regions, and 2) dome-shaped and rifted rises. Tessera is the oldest stratigraphic unit and its association with the plateau-like highlands suggests that they formed near the beginning of the observable history during the tectonically dominated regime. Regional plains preferentially occur within the lowland regions. The correlation of the older tectonized units and the vast volcanic plains with this regional topographic pattern suggests that the major features of the long-wavelength topography of Venus (the plateau-like highs and the lowlands) formed prior to emplacement of regional plains. Lobate plains and rift zones postdate formation of regional plains and are closely associated with the dome-shaped rises. The characteristic features of lobate plains and rift zones match the gravity and topography signatures of the rises and suggest that they were active during the latest episodes of the history of Venus. The alignment of wrinkle ridges and the topographic configuration of the upper sub-unit of regional plains and lobate plains suggest that the beginning of formation of the rises somewhat overlapped the late stages of formation of regional plains. Volcanic Styles The main volcanic plains have different morphologies that indicate different volcanic styles. Small and abundant volcanic constructs of the older shield plains imply that their sources were pervasive and nearly globally distributed, but that the supply of magma at individual sources was limited. The steep-sided domes are spatially and stratigraphically associated with the shield plains. The small size of the constructs of shield plains and their association with the steep-sided domes are most consistent with shallow crustal melting and differentiation of magma in reservoirs and/or partial melting of the crustal materials. Regional plains that postdate shield plains are very abundant (∼1/3 of the surface of Venus) and ubiquitous but their sources are not visible at the available resolution. These features strongly suggest that regional plains formed by voluminous volcanic eruptions from near globally distributed sources. This style of volcanic activity resembles that of terrestrial flood volcanism, but its scale is more easily reconciled with the decompression melting of a fertile mantle layer that underplated the crust. The style of volcanism of the younger lobate plains was distinctly different from those of shield plains and regional plains. The numerous flows of lobate plains suggest multiple episodes of volcanic activity. The areal distribution of lobate plains implies that their sources were discrete, that they formed in different areas at different times, and that some of them may represent feeders of radiating dike swarms. Several lines of evidence suggest that lobate plains formed during a prolonged time span from just after the emplacement of regional plains until geologically recent times. Volumes and Fluxes Estimates of the volume of the main volcanic units on Venus show that both shield plains and regional plains are the major contributors to the volcanic resurfacing on Venus. The total volume of volcanic materials erupted during the volcanically dominant regime is estimated to be from about 140 to 200x106 km3. In sharp contrast to this, the total estimated volume of lobate plains is much smaller, ∼20-30 x106 km3, corresponding to a volcanic flux that is about an order of magnitude smaller that the average intraplate volcanic flux on Earth. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Green2019,
abstract = {The duration of infrasonic signals recorded by sensors on the Earth's surface increases with source-to-receiver distance, due to the increased separation of the fastest and slowest portions of the wavefield propagating within atmospheric acoustic waveguides. An algorithm has been developed to consistently measure signal duration, where signals are identified from a combination of multichannel coherence (semblance) and pressure amplitude. The method allows for changes in the signal propagation vector (backazimuth, apparent velocity) across the extent of the signal, which is important for waveguide ducted signals that exhibit multiple arrivals. The algorithm has been applied to 43 infrasound signals exhibiting envelope signal-to-noise ratios ≥3 in the 0.32 to 1.28Hz passband. All signals were recorded on microbarometer arrays of the International Monitoring System, which is one element of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty verification regime. The data set contains recordings at distances of between 20 and 6300km from ground truth events that are known to have short source-time functions. The results indicate that signal duration is dependent upon both source-to-receiver range and along-path variability in the strength of the stratospheric waveguide, as measured by the ratio of effective sound speeds in the stratosphere and at the ground. For paths with low along-path waveguide variability the signal duration, D (s), exhibits a weak linear relationship with source-to-receiver range, r (km), such that duration can be estimated as D = 0.278r+ 122. The signal durations are reduced when the propagation paths exhibit waveguide strength variability; in the small number of such cases reported in this paper, signals recorded at source-to-receiver ranges of {\textgreater}3000km exhibit D {\~{}}300s. Ray racing simulations indicate that horizontal gradients in waveguide strength act to restrict the signal celerities that can be supported by stratospheric waveguide propagation. Current infrasound signal association and location algorithms do not utilize a signal characteristic from which the source-to-receiver range can be directly estimated. Therefore, the incorporation of a signal duration model into such procedures may provide reduced rates of false signal association and improved event localization.},

abstract = {The summertime Martian PBL diurnal wind variation, slope winds, and the nocturnal low-level jets were studied using Prandtl's theory, a mesoscale numerical model, and Viking lander observations. During moderate prevailing large-scale flow, nocturnal jets were simulated that were rather similar to those on Earth. They were mainly caused by inertial oscillation after sunset with some contribution from the slope wind effects over sloping regions (which are very common in Mars). During weak large-scale flow, shallow nocturnal drainage flows with strong vertical shear developed over the cold Martian slopes. At middle and high latitudes, these katabatic winds tended to turn to flow along the slope by dawn (due to the Coriolis force). For sufficiently steep slopes, near-surface drainage winds could reach considerable speeds. In contrast, the typical afternoon upslope winds were vertically homogeneous up to 2-3 km and weak (only 1-3 m s-1 in magnitude), even over relatively steep large-scale slopes. -Authors},

abstract = {Infrasonic signals have been observed from 31 earthquakes by arrays of microphones operated by the Los Alamos National Laboratory between 1983 and 2003. The properties of the signals are presented. Signal amplitudes corrected for propagation and distance show a relation with seismic magnitude. The variance in the relation is understood primarily in terms of the uncertainties or errors in the ground motion, deduced from an independent data set, and the stratospheric winds, which strongly influence signal propagation. Signal durations can extend over many minutes. A relation is found between signal duration and magnitude. To understand this, we propose a model in which regions distant from the epicenter are excited by seismic surface waves. The surface motion of these regions, in turn, produces signals which precede or follow the signals from the epicenter. Analysis failed to detect signals from 56 earthquakes during the observation period. Predicted signal-to-noise ratios for these earthquakes indicated that the signals would have been too weak for detection.},

@article{Haberle1994,
abstract = {We have constructed a model that predicts the evolution of CO2 on Mars from the end of the heavy bombardment period to the present. The model draws on published estimates of the main processes believed to affect the fate of CO2 during this period: chemical weathering, regolith uptake, polar cap formation, and atmospheric escape. Except for escape, the rate at which these processes act is controlled by surface temperatures which we calculate using a modified version of the Gierasch and Toon energy balance model (1973, J. Atmos. Sci. 30, 1502-1508). The modifications account for the change in solar luminosity with time, the greenhouse effect, and a polar and equatorial energy budget. Using published estimates for the main parameters, we find no evolutionary scenario in which CO2 is capable of producing a warm (global mean temperatures {\textgreater}250 K) and wet (surface pressures {\textgreater}30 mbar) early climate, and then evolves to present conditions with ∼7 mbar in the atmosphere, {\textless}300 mbar in the regolith, and {\textless}5 mbar in the caps. Such scenarios would only exist if the early sun were brighter than standard solar models suggest, if greenhouse gases other than CO2 were present in the early atmosphere, or if the polar albedo were significantly lower than 0.75. However, these scenarios generally require the storage of large amounts of CO2 ({\textgreater}1 bar) in the carbonate reservoir. If the warm and wet early Mars constraint is relaxed, then we find best overall agreement with present day reservoirs for initial CO2 inventories of 0.5-1.0 bar. We also find that the polar caps can have a profound effect on how the system evolves. If the initial amount of CO2 is less than some critical value, then there is not enough heating of the poles to prevent permanent caps from forming. Once formed, these caps control how the system evolves, because they set the surface pressure and, hence, the thermal environment. If the initial amount of CO2 is greater than this critical value, then caps do not form initially, but can form later on, when weathering and escape lower the surface pressure to a point at which polar heating is no longer sufficient to prevent cap formation and the collapse of the climate system. Our modeling suggests this critical initial amount of CO2 is between 1 and 2 bar, but its true value will depend on all factors affecting the polar heat budget. {\textcopyright} 1994 by Academic Press, Inc.},

abstract = {Trapped modes, localized oscillations in unbounded media, are referred to in different contexts by various names; acoustic resonances, Rayleigh-Bloch waves, edge waves, array guided surface waves and bound states being examples. Most studies have concentrated on such phenomena in situations where they are associated with a cut-off frequency below which wave propagation is not possible. It is much more difficult to establish the existence of trapped modes in regions of parameter space which permit energy to travel to infinity. In this article, we review recent results on these so-called embedded modes and discuss problems for future research. There are two distinct cases to consider. First, we consider trapped modes in waveguides governed by the Helmholtz equation. Such problems arise when considering obstacles in acoustic waveguides or bound states in quantum wires, for example. In two dimensions, the same equations govern water-wave channels after the depth dependence has been removed. Second, we examine situations from water-wave theory in which the potential satisfies Laplace's equation with the frequency parameter now appearing in the free-surface boundary condition. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Authors 2015. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Royal Astronomical Society.We document two kinds of traveling ionospheric disturbances, namely, CTIDs (Co-tsunami- Traveling-Ionospheric-disturbances) and ATIDs (Ahead-of-Tsunami-Traveling-Ionosphericdisturbances) related to the Tohoku-Oki tsunami of 2011 March 11. They are referred to the disturbances that remain behind and ahead of the principal tsunami wave front, respectively. We first note their presence in a numerical experiment performed using a simulation code coupling the tsunami, atmosphere and ionosphere. This code uses the tsunami wavefield as an input and simulates acoustic-gravity waves (AGWs) in the atmosphere and TIDs, in the form of total electron content (TEC) disturbance, in the ionosphere. The simulated TEC reveals the excitation of CTIDs (at about 2 TECU) and ATIDs (at about 1 TECU), representing up to 5 per cent disturbance over the ambient electron density, and they arise from the dissipation of AGWs in the thermosphere. A novel outcome is that during the tsunami passage between {\~{}}6° and 12° of epicentral distance, strong ATIDs arrive {\~{}}20-60 min ahead of the tsunami wave front covering {\~{}}3°-10° of distance from the tsunami location. Simulation results are compared with the far-field observations using GNSS satellites and confirm that ATIDs are the first detected TEC maximum, occurring 20-60 min ahead of the tsunami arrival. Our simulation also confirms the presence of largest TEC maximum representing CTIDs, 10- 20 min after the first tsunami wave. ATIDs reported in this study have characteristics that can be potentially used for the early warning of the tsunami.},

@article{Kaser2006,
abstract = {SUMMARY We present a new numerical approach to solve the elastic wave equation in heterogeneous media in the presence of externally given source terms with arbitrary high-order accuracy in space and time on unstructured triangular meshes. We combine a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method with the ideas of the ADER time integration approach using Arbitrary high-order DERivatives.Thetime integration is performedvia the so-calledCauchy-Kovalewskiprocedure using repeatedly the governing partial differential equation itself. In contrast to classical finite element methods we allow for discontinuities of the piecewise polynomial approximation of the solution at element interfaces. This way, we can use the well-established theory of fluxes across element interfaces based on the solution of Riemann problems as developed in the finite volume framework. In particular, we replace time derivatives in the Taylor expansion of the time integration procedure by space derivatives to obtain a numerical scheme of the same high order in space and time using only one single explicit step to evolve the solution from one time level to another. The method is specially suited for linear hyperbolic systems such as the heterogeneous elastic wave equations and allows an efficient implementation.We consider continuous sources in space and time and point sources characterized by a Delta distribution in space and some continuous source time function. Hereby, the method is able to deal with point sources at any position in the computational domain that does not necessarily need to coincide with a mesh point. Interpolation is automatically performed by evaluation of test functions at the source locations. The convergence analysis demonstrates that very high accuracy is retained even on strongly irregular meshes and by increasing the order of the ADER–DG schemes computational time and storage space can be reduced remarkably. Applications of the proposed method to Lamb's Problem, a problem of strong material heterogeneities and to an example of global seismic wave propagation finally confirm its accuracy, robustness and high flexibility.},

abstract = {The analytical study of the reflection and transmission coefficient of the seafloor interface is essential for the characterization of the ocean bottom in marine seismic exploration. Based on the boundary conditions of the seafloor interface, the analytical expression of the reflection and transmission coefficient at the submarine interface is derived in this study by using the steady-state wave solution of the elastic wave in a homogeneous, isotropic medium. With this analytical expression, the characteristics of the reflection and transmission coefficient at the submarine interface are analysed and discussed using critical angles. The results show that the change in the reflection and transmission coefficient with the incidence angle presents a “segmented” characteristic, in which the critical angle is the dividing point. The amplitude value and phase angle of the coefficient at the submarine interface change dramatically at the critical angle, which is related to the P- and S-wave velocities in the seabed layer. Compared with the stiff seabed, the soft seabed has a larger P-wave critical angle and an absence of the converted S-wave critical angle, owing to the low P- and S-wave velocities in the solid seabed layer. By analysing and discussing the special changes that occur in the coefficient values at the critical angle, the reflection and transmission characteristics of the different incident angles are obtained. Synthetic models of both stiff and soft seafloors are provided in this study to verify the analytical results. Finally, we compared our synthetic results with real data from the Gulf of Mexico, which enabled the validation of our conclusions.},

abstract = {Electromagnetic perturbations caused by natural geophysical activity, such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, have been studied since the great Alaskan earthquake in 1964. In recent years, interest has been increasing because, when a precursor event occurs, it normally does so less than a few hours before the shock. This paper presents a review of the high-frequency seismo-electromagnetic phenomena already observed, and occurring before, as well as after the shock. The term 'high frequency' is to be taken in the seismic sense, i.e. larger than a few Hertz. Mechanisms that might produce these seismo-electromagnetic emissions will be described. It is shown that, at the moment, a causal relationship between electromagnetic signals and seismic activity still remains to be demonstrated. Theoretical as well as intensive experimental studies are necessary to understand the physical processes responsible for seismo or volcano-electric variations, electrical resistivity variations, electromagnetic effects associated with dilatance, as well as electromagnetic fields generated during laboratory experiments, or ionospheric disturbances. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {New empirical traveltime curves for the major seismic phases have been derived from the catalogues of the International Seismological Centre by relocating events by using P readings, depth phases and the iasp91 traveltimes, and then re‐associating phase picks. A smoothed set of traveltime tables is extracted by a robust procedure which gives estimates of the variance of the traveltimes for each phase branch. This set of smoothed empirical times is then used to construct a range of radial velocity profiles, which are assessed against a number of different measures of the level of fit between the empirical times and the predictions of the models. These measures are constructed from weighted sums of L2 misfits for individual phases. The weights are chosen to provide a measure of the probable reliability of the picks for the different phases. A preferred model, ak135, is proposed which gives a significantly better fit to a broad range of phases than is provided by the iasp91 and sp6 models. The differences in velocity between ak135 and these models are generally quite small except at the boundary of the inner core, where reduced velocity gradients are needed to achieve satisfactory performance for PKP differential time data. The potential resolution of velocity structure has been assessed with the aid of a non‐linear search procedure in which 5000 models have been generated in bounds about ak135. Msfit calculations are performed for each of the phases in the empirical traveltime sets, and the models are then sorted using different overall measures of misfit. The best 100 models for each criterion are displayed in a model density plot which indicates the consistency of the different models. The interaction of information from different phases can be analysed by comparing the different misfit measures. Structure in the mantle is well resolved except at the base, and ak135 provides a good representation of core velocities. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1995, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

abstract = {Irregularities and irregular motions in the upper atmosphere have been detected and studied by a variety of techniques during recent years, but their proper interpretation has yet to be established. It is shown here that many or most of the observational data may be interpreted on the basis of a single physical mechanism, namely, internal atmospheric gravity waves. A comprehensive picture is envisaged for the motions normally encountered, in which a spectruin of waves is generated at low levels of the atmosphere and propagated tipwards. The propagational effects of amplification, reflection, inter- modulation, and dissipation act to change the spectrum continuously with increasing height, and so produce different types of dominant modes at different heights. These changes, coupled with an observational selection in some cases, lead to the various characteristics revealed by the different observing techniques. The generation of abnormal waves locally .in the ionosphere appears to be possible, and it seems able to account for unusual motions sometimes observed. I.},

abstract = {The multilayer approximation previously used to study propagation in wind-free atmospheres is extended to include winds. Two generalized acoustic potentials are defined which are continuous even at horizontal discontinuities in wind velocity or sound speed and the residual equations which these quantities satisfy are derived. Two dispersion functions are defined whose roots give the phase-velocity magnitude and phase-velocity direction for normal-mode waves propagating with given frequency and given group-velocity direction. The multilayer approximation is introduced for computing these dispersion functions by approximating continuously stratified atmospheres with models consisting of a finite number of layers, each with constant wind velocity and sound speed. Numerical methods for finding the roots of the dispersion function are discussed. The theory is then applied to an example of a multilayered atmosphere and curves, for several horizontal group-velocity directions, of phase-velocity, group-velocity, and phase-velocity direction versus frequency are tabulated for several normal modes. {\textcopyright} 1967.},

abstract = {The emission of acoustic gravity wave is discussed for horizontally and uniformly moving sources in an unbounded isothermal atmosphere. For a point and a finite line source the dispersion characteristics are fully considered. It is found that the radiation field for a finite line source is identical to that for an infinite line source for a certain initial period after the disturbance arrives at an observer. But, later, the end effect is observed complicating the field. Still later, with the source receding far from the observer the field of a finite line source tends to be that of a point source. Generally, because of peculiar dispersion, unlike the acoustic wave the gravity wave can be radiated both for supersonic and subsonic motions. In the asymptotic case the frequency characteristics are fairly similar in all cases. The present numerical integration shows that the saddle point and stationary phase methods are fairly valid except for the very near field. {\textcopyright} 1977.},

abstract = {Artificial viscosity can be combined with a higher-order discontinuous Galerkin finite element discretization to resolve a shock layer within a single cell. However, when a non-smooth artificial viscosity model is employed with an otherwise higher-order approximation, element-to-element variations induce oscillations in state gradients and pollute the downstream flow. To alleviate these difficulties, this work proposes a higher-order, state-based artificial viscosity with an associated governing partial differential equation (PDE). In the governing PDE, a shock indicator acts as a forcing term while grid-based diffusion is added to smooth the resulting artificial viscosity. When applied to heat transfer prediction on unstructured meshes in hypersonic flows, the PDE-based artificial viscosity is less susceptible to errors introduced by grid edges oblique to captured shocks and boundary layers, thereby enabling accurate heat transfer predictions. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Fukuhara2017,
abstract = {The planet Venus is covered by thick clouds of sulfuric acid that move westwards because the entire upper atmosphere rotates much faster than the planet itself. At the cloud tops, about 65 km in altitude, small-scale features are predominantly carried by the background wind at speeds of approximately 100 m s {\^{a}} '1. In contrast, planetary-scale atmospheric features have been observed to move slightly faster or slower than the background wind, a phenomenon that has been interpreted to reflect the propagation of planetary-scale waves. Here we report the detection of an interhemispheric bow-shaped structure stretching 10,000 km across at the cloud-top level of Venus in middle infrared and ultraviolet images from the Japanese orbiter Akatsuki. Over several days of observation, the bow-shaped structure remained relatively fixed in position above the highland on the slowly rotating surface, despite the background atmospheric super rotation. We suggest that the bow-shaped structure is the result of an atmospheric gravity wave generated in the lower atmosphere by mountain topography that then propagated upwards. Numerical simulations provide preliminary support for this interpretation, but the formation and propagation of a mountain gravity wave remain difficult to reconcile with assumed near-surface conditions on Venus. We suggest that winds in the deep atmosphere may be spatially or temporally more variable than previously thought.},

@article{Assink2014a,
abstract = {In January 2011, the state of the polar vortex in the midlatitudes changed significantly due to a minor sudden stratospheric warming event. As a result, a bidirectional duct for infrasound propagation developed in the middle atmosphere that persisted for 2 weeks. The ducts were due to two zonal wind jets, one between 30 and 50 km and the other around 70 km altitude. In this paper, using microbarom source modeling, a previously unidentified source region in the eastern Mediterranean is identified, besides the more well known microbarom source regions in the Atlantic Ocean. Infrasound data are then presented in which the above mentioned bidirectional duct is observed in microbarom signals recorded at the International Monitoring System station I48TN in Tunisia, from the Mediterranean region to the east and from the Atlantic Ocean to the west. While the frequency bands of the two sources overlap, the Mediterranean signal is coherent up to about 0.6 Hz. This observation is consistent with the microbarom source modeling; the discrepancy in the frequency band is related to differences in the ocean wave spectra for the two basins considered. This work demonstrates the sensitivity of infrasound to stratospheric dynamics and illustrates that the classic paradigm of a unidirectional stratospheric duct for infrasound propagation can be broken during a sudden stratospheric warming event.},

abstract = {Winds and temperature gradients greatly affect the long-range propagation of infrasound. The spatio-temporal variability of these parameters must therefore be accurately characterized to correctly interpret recorded infrasound at long distances, specifically to differentiate between source and propagation effects. Here we present the first results of an open source reanalysis model, termed Alaska Volcano Observatory Ground-to-Space (AVO-G2S), constructed to accurately characterize the atmosphere and model long-range infrasound propagation from volcanic eruptions in Alaska. We select a number of case studies to examine recent eruptions of Alaskan volcanoes whose ash emissions posed a threat to air traffic, including the two most recent eruptions of Pavlof Volcano and two typical explosions from Cleveland Volcano. Strong tropospheric ducting and low noise at the station during the 21 July 2015 explosion of Cleveland Volcano led to an automated detection of the explosion at an infrasound array 992 km away, whereas low signal-to-noise ratio for the 6 November 2014 Cleveland Volcano explosion helps explain the non-detection in real-time of a predicted strong stratospheric arrival. For the November 2014 Pavlof eruption, discrepancies between local seismic data and a distal infrasound array 460 km away cannot be solely explained by changes in atmospheric conditions, though some features of the complex propagation predictions follow the trends in long-range infrasound signals. The most recent eruption of Pavlof Volcano in March 2016 shows minimal changes in propagation conditions throughout the eruption and therefore indicates that the signals detected at long-range primarily reflect source processes. These results show how detailed examination of the acoustic propagation conditions provides insight into detection capability and eruption dynamics. Future work will implement AVO-G2S and high-resolution long-range infrasound propagation modeling in real-time for Alaskan volcanoes of interest.},

abstract = {The complex-frequency-shifted perfectly matched layer (CFS-PML) technique can efficiently absorb near-grazing inci- dent waves. In seismic wave modeling, CFS-PML has been im- plemented by the first-order-accuracy convolutional PML tech- nique or second-order-accuracy recursive convolution PML technique. Both use different algorithms than the numerical scheme for the interior domain to update auxiliary memory vari- ables in thePMLand thus cannot be used directly with higher-or- der time-marching schemes.We work with an unsplit-field CFS- PML implementation using auxiliary differential equations (ADEs) to update the auxiliary memory variables. This ADE CFS-PML results in complete first-order differential equations. Thus, the numerical scheme for the interior domain can be used to solveADE CFS-PML equations.We have implementedADE CFS-PML in the finite-difference time-domain method and in a nonstaggered-grid finite-difference method with the fourth-order Runge-Kutta scheme, demonstrating its straightforward imple- mentation in different numerical time-marching schemes. We have also theoretically analyzed the role of the scalingfactor of CFS-PML; it transforms the PML to a transversely isotropic ma- terial, reducing the effective wave speed normal to thePMLlayer and bending the wavefront toward the normal direction of the PML layer.Our numerical tests indicate that the optimal value re- duces the points per dominant wavelength at the outermost boundary to three, about half the value required by the numerical scheme.We also have found that the PML equations should be derived taking the free-surface boundary condition into account in finite-difference methods. Otherwise, the free surface in the PMLlayer causes instability or ineffective absorption of surface waves.Testsshowthatwecan use a narrow-slice mesh with ADE CFS-PML to simulate full wave propagation efficiently in models with complex structure.},

Detailed inspection of the syn-eruptive seismograms revealed the presence of an ultra long-period mode at a frequency of 1.7 mHz, which is not a characteristic of the background seismic noise at Okmok. Data collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) and National Aeronautical and Space Administration Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors displayed the propagation of a vigorous ash-and-steam plume up to about 17 km above sea level. We suggest that the observed ultra long-period signals represent the response of the seismometer to changes in gravity associated with buoyancy oscillations set off in the lower atmosphere above Okmok by the emplacement of the eruption column. Calculations based on simple modeling of these effects allowed estimation of peak atmospheric pressure perturbations associated with the eruption of less than 1 mbar.},

We show that the transparency of the interface increases dramatically at low frequencies. Almost all acoustic energy emitted by a sufficiently shallow monopole source under water is predicted to be radiated into air. Increased transparency at lower frequencies is due to the increasing role of inhomogeneous waves. For sources symmetric with respect to a horizontal plane, transparency is further increased by a destructive interference of direct and surface-reflected waves under water. The phenomenon of anomalous transparency has significant geophysical and biological implications. {\textcopyright} 2006 The American Physical Society.},

The model is parameterized laterally by tessellated nodes and vertically as a series of geophysically identified layers, such as water, ice, sediments, crystalline crust, lithospheric lid, and asthenosphere. LITHO1.0 is created by constructing an appropriate starting model and perturbing it to fit high-resolution surface wave dispersion maps (Love and Rayleigh, group and phase) over a wide frequency band (5--40 mHz). We examine and discuss the model with respect to key lithospheric parameters, such as average crustal velocity, crustal thickness, upper mantle velocity, and lithospheric thickness. We then compare the constructed model to those from a number of select studies at regional and global scales and find general consistency. It appears that LITHO1.0 represents a reasonable starting model of the Earth's shallow structure (crust and uppermost mantle) for the purposes in which these models are used, such as traveltime tomography or in efforts to create a 3-D reference Earth model. The model matches surface wave dispersion over a frequency band wider than the band used in the inversion. There are several avenues for improving the model in the future by including attenuation and anisotropy, as well as making use of surface waves at higher frequency.},

Here we report observations of Venus' ionosphere that reveal strong, circularly polarized, electromagnetic waves with frequencies near 100 Hz.

Unlike most previous studies, the modeled area of maximum infrasound radiation appears to mimic an extended flat area (plain of the Po River) with no significant contributions from nearby mountain ranges. The ShakeMap of the earthquake and the map of the reported acoustic boom are in good agreement with the modeled area of infrasound radiation, suggesting how the transition of seismic waves into acoustic atmospheric waves is efficiently exciting infrasound recorded at far distances from the source. Such a result is in agreement with the significant seismic amplification within the Po plain alluvial sediments.},

The continuously differentiable limiter is shown to be effective for strong discontinuities, even on a grid which is composed of highly distorted triangles, without adversely affecting convergence to steady state.

We are solving the compressible Navier-Stokes equations for unsteady turbulent flow simulations. We use explicit time stepping because of the high parallel scalability and also because the physical time scale of the simulation is in the range of the explicit time step restriction. In the explicit DGSEM framework, the efficiency of element-wise operations is highly improved compared to standard DG implementations. This improvement is due to collocated interpolation and integration points and tensor product nodal basis functions inside the hexahedron. In the first part of this paper, we describe the DGSEM scheme and derive the element-wise operators. We will conclude this part with accuracy and convergence analysis. The locality of the explicit DGSEM scheme is highly attractive for parallel computing, thus the second part is dedicated to a parallel performance analysis of the code. In the last part, we show the applicability of the scheme with a direct numerical simulation of a weak turbulent flow past a sphere at Reynolds number 1000. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Infrasound Monitoring for Atmospheric Studies 7 8 Abstract 9 Infrasound monitoring is employed to enhance understanding of eruption dynamics and 10 to track eruptive activity over time. Local infrasound, where sensors are positioned near 11 to and/or on the flanks of volcanoes, implies that sound transmission from vent to 12 receiver is approximately line-of-sight. Typical assumptions are that pressure decays as 13 the inverse of distance and that attenuation and dispersion effects are minimal. Locally-14 recorded signals thus represent relatively undistorted source-time motions and can be 15 used to effectively characterize volcanic activity. Local monitoring can entail a spectrum 16 of installation topologies including single isolated sensors on a volcano, networks of 17 sensors, a single array, or networks of sensor arrays. Stations may be installed as stand-18 alone or in telemetered configurations depending upon available resources and research 19 objectives, which may range from simple explosion counting to degassing detection, 20 mapping of vents, or identification of moving sources. Some of these objectives are only 21 possible using arrays. Quantifying volcano infrasound, in terms of both spectral shape, 22 power, and signal envelope, is relatively straightforward using data recorded at local 23 distances. Despite inter-network variability, influenced by potential source directivity, 24 propagation effects, and/or site response, the local infrasound records permit good 25 estimation of total acoustic energy, identification of dominant spectral tones, and signal 26 morphology. These parameters may be robustly compared at a volcano over time and/or 27 compared to other volcanoes. Ultimately, infrasound analysis permits remote 28 surveillance of activity occurring at the vent (or on the slopes) of a volcano that may 29 otherwise be difficult to observe. 30 31},

abstract = {This chapter examines the potential improvements in tropospheric weather forecasts that might arise from an enhanced representation of the upper stratospheric state. First, the chapter reviews current operational practice regarding observation of the atmosphere and the relative paucity of observations in the altitude range 40–70 km. Then, we describe some idealised model calculations to quantify the potential gain in skill available from improved monitoring in this region. The idealised model experiments use a relaxation technique with the Hadley Centre General Environment Model, to assess the potential gain in skill from observations both of the whole stratosphere and the upper stratosphere. At weather forecasting timescales (up to forecast day 30), better knowledge of the stratosphere, close to the onset of a sudden stratospheric warming, improves forecasts of the tropospheric northern annular mode. Whole-stratosphere information significantly improved average surface temperature anomalies over northern North America, whilst upper stratosphere information improved anomalies over Central Siberia. These results suggest any new observational technique which can contribute to monitoring of the 40–70 km region would likely benefit tropospheric forecast skill during wintertime.},

abstract = {Perfectly matched layers (PML) are a recent technique for simulating the absorption of waves in open domains. They have been introduced for electromagnetic waves and extended, since then, to other models of wave propagation, including waves in elastic anisotropic media. In this last case, some numerical experiments have shown that the PMLs are not always stable. In this paper, we investigate this question from a theoretical point of view. In the first part, we derive a necessary condition for the stability of the PML model for a general hyperbolic system. This condition can be interpreted in terms of geometrical properties of the slowness diagrams and used for explaining instabilities observed with elastic waves but also with other propagation models (anisotropic Maxwell's equations, linearized Euler equations). In the second part, we specialize our analysis to orthotropic elastic waves and obtain separately a necessary stability condition and a sufficient stability condition that can be expressed in terms of inequalities on the elasticity coefficients of the model. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {The Akatsuki instrument LIR measured an unprecedented wave feature at the top of Venusian cloud layer. Stationary bow-shape waves of thousands of kilometers large lasting several Earth days have been observed over the main equatorial mountains. Here we use for the first time a mesoscale model of the Venus's atmosphere with high-resolution topography and fully coupled interactive radiative transfer computations. Mountain waves resolved by the model form large-scale bow shape waves with an amplitude of about 1.5 K and a size up to several decades of latitude similar to the ones measured by the Akatsuki spacecraft. The maximum amplitude of the waves appears in the afternoon due to an increase of the near-surface stability. Propagating vertically the waves encounter two regions of low static stability, the mixed layer between approximately 18 and 30 km and the convective layer between 50 and 55 km. Some part of the wave energy can pass through these regions via wave tunneling. These two layers act as wave filter, especially the deep atmosphere layer. The encounter with these layers generates trapped lee waves propagating horizontally. No stationary waves is resolved at cloud top over the polar regions because of strong circumpolar transient waves, and a thicker deep atmosphere mixed layer that filters most the mountain waves},

abstract = {The guided acoustic-gravity modes that can propagate in a realistic dissipative atmosphere are computed for periods between 30 sec and 2 hours. The analysis differs from previous treatments by including dissipation (viscosity and thermal conductivity) and by using a realistic sound speed profile throughout the thermosphere. The presence of realistic dis- sipation allows a unique determination of the acoustic-gravity mode spectrum free from ambiguities related to the choice of the upper boundary condition. Since the atmospheric model below the thermosphere is similar to those used in previous studies, the characteristics of the lower atmospheric modes (e.g., the Lamb mode) are essentially unchanged from previous analyses of fully ducted modes in dissipationless atmospheres. The attenuation distances of these lower atmospheric modes, defined as the distances required for the modes to be attenuated by a factor of l/e, are of the order of the earth's circumference or greater. The upper atmospheric modes, on the other hand, exhibit several characteristics that disagree with the results of previous analyses. The calculations reported here reveal the existence of several long-period modes with average speeds between 300 and 700 m/sec, all composed at F region heights of internal gravity waves with nearly horizontal phase fronts. Their attenuation distances are of the order of 1/8 of the way around the earth or less. All the properties of these upper atmospheric modes agree qualitatively with the observed char- acteristics of large-scale F region traveling disturbances (TID's). Ion drag is not found to be particularly important, but changes of thermospheric temperature due to diurnal and solar cycle variations are found to have quite appreciable effects on the upper atmospheric modes.},

abstract = {On February 15, 2013 a small asteroid entered Earth's atmosphere near Chelyabinsk, Russia. This extremely rare event was recorded by the 400-station USArray deployed in the continental United States and Alaska. These stations recorded infrasound signals from the event at distances from 6000 to 10000 km across a sector spanning 55° that encompassed the North Pole. This dense, extensive network permitted a detailed study of long-range infrasound propagation and source characteristics. We observe long wavetrains at all stations (ranging to over 100 min) but clear variations in the character of the wavetrains across the network. Ray-tracing through a spatially and temporally varying atmospheric model indicates the source excited resonance in the thermospheric duct to all stations. Resonance was also excited in a persistent stratospheric duct between the source and stations in Alaska and along the west coast of the United States due to favorable winds at those azimuths, leading to higher group velocities and frequency content at these stations than those to the east. An attenuation formula derived from parabolic equation simulations is used to estimate infrasound transmission losses at all stations, using simplified models of the effective sound speed along each source-receiver path. Observed variations in signal energies from higher than expected at stations in the thermospheric duct in the eastern United States, to lower than expected in Alaska, at azimuths nearly orthogonal to the asteroid's Mach cone, lead us to conclude that (1) the source was dominantly isotropic and (2) the model overestimates attenuation in the thermospheric duct.},

abstract = {SUMMARY This work aims at quantifying the effect of inherent uncertainties from cardiac output on the sensitivity of a human compliant arterial network response based on stochastic simulations of a reduced-order pulse wave propagation model. A simple pulsatile output form is utilized to reproduce the most relevant cardiac features with a minimum number of parameters associated with left ventricle dynamics. Another source of critical uncertainty is the spatial heterogeneity of the aortic compliance which plays a key role in the propagation and damping of pulse waves generated at each cardiac cycle. A continuous representation of the aortic stiffness in the form of a generic random field of prescribed spatial correlation is then considered. Resorting to a stochastic sparse pseudospectral method, we investigate the spatial sensitivity of the pulse pressure and waves reflection magnitude with respect to the different model uncertainties. Results indicate that uncertainties related to the shape and magnitude of the prescribed inlet flow in the proximal aorta can lead to potent variation of both the mean value and standard deviation of blood flow velocity and pressure dynamics due to the interaction of different wave propagation and reflection features. These results have potential physiological and pathological implications. They will provide some guidance in clinical data acquisition and future coupling of arterial pulse wave propagation reduced-order model with more complex beating heart models.},

abstract = {Relations between auroral activities and the generation of neutral-wind oscillations in the polar F region (150-300 km) were investigated using data from the European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) radar, the all-sky auroral camera, and the IMAGE (International Monitor for Auroral Geomagnetic Effects) magnetograms. We dealt with two cases: observations on March 1, 1995 (case 1), and on March 29, 1995 (case 2). For both cases the field-aligned component of the neutral-wind velocity estimated from EISCAT radar data had dominant oscillation periods of 20-30 min, which are longer than the typical Brunt-V{\"{a}}is{\"{a}}l{\"{a}} period in the polar F region (≃13 min). The observed oscillations showed the downward propagation of the phase with time. These properties on the oscillation period and the phase are general ones of atmospheric gravity waves (AGWs). For case 1 the all-sky auroral images obtained at Kilpisj{\"{a}}rvi showed the auroral arc extending in an almost zonal direction near a distance estimated using wave parameters derived from the equation of the dispersion relation for AGWs applicable to the observed oscillations. This suggested that the auroral arc appeared to be the effective generator of the observed oscillations. The comparison of observed phase lines with predicted ones using models by Francis [1974] and Kato et al. [1977] showed agreements between the two for both cases. The comparison suggests that effective parameters of the wave source in characterizing neutral-wind oscillations would be the horizontal distribution of the wave source and the distance between the observing point and the source region. It was concluded that geomagnetic activities on March 1 and 29, 1995, in northern Scandinavia significantly related to the generation of the observed oscillations. The conclusion implies that geomagnetic activities at high latitudes are an important source to generate AGWs, as indicated by previous theoretical studies.

abstract = {NASA's InSight mission to Mars will measure seismic signals to determine the planet's interior structure. These highly sensitive seismometers are susceptible to corruption of their measurements by environmental changes. Magnetic fields, atmosphere pressure changes, and local winds can all induce apparent changes in the seismic records that are not due to propagating ground motions. Thus, InSight carries a set of sensors called the Auxiliary Payload Sensor Suite (APSS) which includes a magnetometer, an atmospheric pressure sensor, and a pair of wind and air temperature sensors. In the case of the magnetometer, knowledge of the amplitude of the fluctuating magnetic field at the InSight lander will allow the separation of seismic signals from potentially interfering magnetic signals of either natural or spacecraft origin. To acquire such data, a triaxial fluxgate magnetometer was installed on the deck of the lander to obtain magnetic records at the same cadence as the seismometer. Similarly, a highly sensitive pressure sensor is carried by InSight to enable the removal of local ground-surface tilts due to advecting pressure perturbations. Finally, the local winds (speed and direction) and air temperature are estimated using a hot-film wind sensor with heritage from REMS on the Curiosity rover. When winds are too high, seismic signals can be ignored or discounted. Herein we describe the APSS sensor suite, the test programs for its components, and the possible additional science investigations it enables.},

In this study, the further detection of large stationary gravity waves in brightness temperature images over a 1.5 year period is reported. The waves periodically appeared mostly above four specific highland regions in the low latitudes when these regions were in the local afternoon. The wave amplitudes attenuated after the wave locations passed beyond the evening terminator, and the locations of the waves tended to slowly drift eastward over their lifetimes. The appearances of stationary waves depend not only on surface topography but also on latitude and local time, suggesting that solar heating during the daytime and atmospheric structure affected by solar heating may control the excitation and propagation of stationary waves.},

In contrast to nearby surface stations, the balloon-borne infrasound array detected signals from turbulence, nonlinear ocean wave interactions, building ventilation systems, and other sources that have not been identified yet. Infrasound power spectra also bore little resemblance to spectra recorded on the ground at the same time. Thus, sensors on the Earth's surface likely capture a fraction of the true diversity of acoustic waves in the atmosphere. Future studies building upon this experiment may quantify the acoustic energy flux from the surface to the upper atmosphere, extend the capability of the International Monitoring System to detect nuclear explosions, and lay the observational groundwork for a recently-proposed mission to detect earthquakes on Venus using free-flying microphones.},

abstract = {We have developed model S40RTS of shear-velocity variation in Earth's mantle using a new collection of Rayleigh wave phase velocity, teleseismic body-wave traveltime and normal-mode splitting function measurements. This data set is an order of magnitude larger than used for S20RTS and includes new data types. The data are related to shear-velocity perturbations from the (anisotropic) PREM model via kernel functions and ray paths that are computed using PREM. Contributions to phase delays and traveltimes from the heterogeneous crust are estimated using model CRUST2.0. We calculate crustal traveltimes from long-period synthetic waveforms rather than using ray theory. Shear-velocity perturbations are parametrized by spherical harmonics up to degree 40 and by 21 vertical spline functions for a total of 35301 degrees of freedom. S40RTS is characterised by 8000 resolved unknowns. Since we compute the exact inverse, it is straightforward to determine models associated with fewer or more unknowns by adjusting the model damping. S40RTS shares many characteristics with S20RTS because it is based on the same data types and similar modelling procedures. However, S40RTS shows more clearly than S20RTS the abrupt change in the pattern of shear-velocity heterogeneity across the 660-km phase transition and it presents a more complex patern of shear-velocity heterogeneity in the lower mantle. Utilities to visualise S40RTS and software to analyse the resolution of S40RTS (or models for different damping parameters) are made available. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors Geophysical Journal International {\textcopyright} 2010 RAS.},

@article{DeCarlo2020,
abstract = {Between 0.1 and 0.5 Hz, infrasound signals recorded in the atmosphere are dominated by ocean-generated noise called microbaroms. Microbaroms propagate through the atmosphere over thousands of kilometres due to low absorption and efficient ducting between the ground and the stratopause. Different theoretical models have been developed to characterize the source of microbaroms, all based on the second-order nonlinear interaction of ocean waves. While early theories considered an infinite ocean depth and a source radiation depending on the acoustic wave elevation angle, other works have approximated the radiation pattern as a monopole, and found a considerable effect of the water depth. This paper reviews these models and extends the previous theories to the combined effects of both finite depth ocean and source directivity in both elevation and azimuth angles. It is found that the water depth has a negligible effect for the near-horizontally propagating acoustic waves that should dominate the measured microbarom records. Another important result is that the microbarom azimuthal variation can be highly directive locally, but it generally becomes isotropic when integrated over a realistic source region.},

The parallel implementation is MPI-based and has been tested on various parallel platforms such as the SGI Origin, IBM SP2, and clusters of SGI and Sun workstations. The scalability results presented for the SGI Origin show slightly superlinear speedup on a fixed-size problem due to cache effects.},

abstract = {The International Monitoring System infrasound network will, upon completion, contain 60 microbarometer arrays with apertures of between 1 and 4 km. These arrays are located within a variety of terrains, leading to large ratios of interelement elevation differences to array aperture for those arrays situated in areas of significant topography. Systematic errors in beamforming estimates caused by neglecting the vertical extent of the arrays, are quantified for both signal backazimuth and apparent velocity. Of the 43 arrays certified as of 2011 January, I14CL on Juan Fernandez Island has the greatest topography across an array, with a least-squares fitted plane through the array elements having an 8.1° slope from the horizontal (compared to a network mean of 1.6°). Beamforming errors (both backazimuth and apparent velocity) are a function of the arrival azimuth and become increasingly large for steeply inclined arrivals, such that systematic errors will be significantly larger for signals returned from the thermosphere compared to those from the stratosphere. At several arrays, azimuthal errors due to array topography are comparable in magnitude to deviations often associated with atmospheric propagation. These findings are illustrated using signals recorded in Greenland at I18DK, where differences between results processed using both full 3-D array geometry and the 2-D (topography neglected) approximation exhibit good correspondence to theoretical predictions.},

Atmospheric flow produced by the mountains is predicted by a nonlinear mountain gravity wave model. For the infrasound component, this paper solves the wave equation under the effective sound speed approximation using both a finite difference method and a Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin approach. It is shown that in realistic configurations, the mountain waves can deeply perturb the low-level waveguide, which leads to significant acoustic dispersion. To interpret these results, each acoustic mode is tracked separately as the horizontal distance increases. It is shown that during statically stable situations, situations that are common during night over land in winter, the mountain waves induce a strong Foehn effect downstream, which shrinks the waveguide significantly. This yields a new form of infrasound absorption that can largely outweigh the direct effect the mountain in...},

Solid earth and atmospheric normal modes are computed for a radiation boundary condition that models the dissipation of acoustic signals in the high atmosphere of the Earth, We show that the coupling between ground and atmosphere occurs at a set of frequencies related to fundamentals and harmonics of atmospheric modes. Spheroidal modes near these frequencies have up to 0.04 per cent of their energy in the atmosphere, and thus may be strongly excited by atmospheric sources.

abstract = {A model for an imperfectly bonded interface between two elastic media is proposed. Displacement across this surface is not required to be continuous. The displacement discontinuity, or slip, is taken to be linearly related to the stress traction which is continuous across the interface. For isotropic interface behavior, there are two complex frequency dependent interface compliances, $\eta$N and $\eta$T, where the component of the slip normal to the interface is given by $\eta$N times the normal stress and the component tangential to the interface is given by $\eta$T times the shear stress and is in the same direction. Reflection and transmission coefficients for harmonic plane waves incident at arbitrary angles upon a plane linear slip interface are computed in terms of the interface compliances. These coefficients are frequency dependent even when the compliances are real and frequency independent. Examples of the effects of buried slip interfaces on reflection coefficient spectra and on Lovewave dispersion relations are presented.},

abstract = {The ChemCam instrument suite on the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover Curiosity provides remote compositional information using the first laser-induced breakdown spectrometer (LIBS) on a planetary mission, and provides sample texture and morphology data using a remote micro-imager (RMI). Overall, ChemCam supports MSL with five capabilities: remote classification of rock and soil characteristics; quantitative elemental compositions including light elements like hydrogen and some elements to which LIBS is uniquely sensitive (e.g., Li, Be, Rb, Sr, Ba); remote removal of surface dust and depth profiling through surface coatings; context imaging; and passive spectroscopy over the 240-905 nm range. ChemCam is built in two sections: The mast unit, consisting of a laser, telescope, RMI, and associated electronics, resides on the rover's mast, and is described in a companion paper. ChemCam's body unit, which is mounted in the body of the rover, comprises an optical demultiplexer, three spectrometers, detectors, their coolers, and associated electronics and data handling logic. Additional instrument components include a 6 m optical fiber which transfers the LIBS light from the telescope to the body unit, and a set of onboard calibration targets. ChemCam was integrated and tested at Los Alamos National Laboratory where it also underwent LIBS calibration with 69 geological standards prior to integration with the rover.

abstract = {Microbaroms are atmospheric pressure oscillations radiated from non-linear ocean surface wave interactions. Large regions of interacting high-energetic ocean waves, e.g., ocean swell and marine storms, radiate almost continuously acoustic energy. Microbaroms dominate the infrasound ambient noise field, which makes them a preferred source for passive atmospheric probing. Microbarom are simulated using a two-fluid model, representing an atmosphere over a finite-depth ocean and a coupled ocean-wave model providing the sea state. Air-sea coupling is crucial due to the two-way interaction between surface winds and ocean waves. In this study, a detailed overview is given on how global microbarom simulations are obtained, including a sensitivity analysis of the various model input data and parameterizations. Simulations are validated by infrasound array observations of the International Monitoring Systems (IMS) of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO). An brief demonstration is given on the added value of global microbarom simulationsfor infrasound studies and how to obtain these source simulations.},

abstract = {Atmospheric sound waves in the 0.02–10 Hz region, also known as infrasound, exhibit long-range global propagation characteristics. Measurable infrasound is produced around the globe on a daily basis by a variety of natural and man-made sources. As a result of weak classical attenuation (∼0.01 dB km−1 at 0.1 hz), these acoustic signals can propagate thousands of kilometers in tropospheric, stratospheric, and lower thermospheric ducts. To model this propagation accurately, detailed knowledge of the background atmospheric state variables, the global winds and temperature fields from the ground to ∼170 km, is required. For infrasound propagation calculations, we have developed a unique atmospheric specification system (G2S) that is capable of providing this information. Using acoustic ray tracing methods and detailed G2S atmospheric specifications, we investigate the major aspects of the spatiotemporal variability of infrasound propagation characteristics.},

abstract = {Celerity-range models, where celerity is defined as the epicentral distance divided by the total traveltime (similar to the definition of group velocity for dispersed seismic surface waves), can be used for the association of infrasound automatic detections, for event location and for the validation of acoustic propagation simulations. Signals recorded from ground truth events are used to establish celerity-range models, but data coverage is uneven in both space and time. To achieve a high density of regional recordings we use data from USArray seismic stations recording air-to-ground coupled waves from explosions during the summers of 2004-2008 at the Utah Training and Test Range, in the western United States, together with data from five microbarograph arrays at regional distances ({\textless}1000 km). We have developed a consistent methodology for analysing the infrasound and seismic data, including choosing filter characteristics from a limited group of two-octave wide filter bands and picking the maximum peak-to-peak arrival. We clearly observe tropospheric, thermospheric and stratospheric arrivals, in agreement with regional ray tracing models. Due to data availability and the dependence of infrasound propagation on the season, we develop three regional celerity-range models for the U.S. summer, with a total of 2211 data picks. The new models suggest event locations using the Geiger method could be improved in terms of both accuracy (up to 80 per cent closer to ground truth) and precision (error ellipse area reduced by {\textgreater}90 per cent) when compared to those estimated using the global International Data Center model, particularly for events where stations detect arrivals at ranges {\textless}350 km. Whilst adding data-based prior information into the Bayesian Infrasound Source Localization (BISL) method is also shown to increase precision, to increase accuracy, the parameter space must be expanded to include station-specific celerity distributions. {\textcopyright} Crown Copyright.

The models have 15 km horizontal grid spacing and an average vertical grid spacing of 4 km, down to 22 km depth, and extend from the U.S.-Mexico border to the Coast Ranges in the south and Sierra Nevada in the north. In general, Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nP$\backslash$nand Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nS$\backslash$nincrease rapidly with depth, consistent with crustal densities and velocities. The 3-D Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nP$\backslash$nand Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nS$\backslash$nmodels image the major tectonic structures and to a much lesser extent the thermal structure of the southern California crust. The near-surface low Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nP$\backslash$nand Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nS$\backslash$nzones coincide with major sedimentary basins such as the San Bernardino, Chino, San Gabriel Valley, Los Angeles, Ventura, and Santa Maria basins and the Salton Trough. In contrast, at shallow depths beneath the Peninsular Ranges, southern Mojave Desert, and southern Sierras, we image high Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nP$\backslash$nand Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nS$\backslash$nzones, which correspond to the dense and high-velocity rocks of the mountain ranges. Several clear transition zones of rapidly varying Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nP$\backslash$nand Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nS$\backslash$ncoincide with major late Quaternary faults and connect regions of high and low Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nP$\backslash$nand Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nS$\backslash$n.

In general, for the southern California crust, Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nS$\backslash$n/Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nP$\backslash$nis greater than 1.0, suggesting partially fluid-saturated crust. A few limited regions of Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nS$\backslash$n/Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nP$\backslash$nless than 1.0 correspond to areas mostly outside the major sedimentary basins, including areas around the San Jacinto fault, suggesting a larger reduction in the shear modulus compared to the bulk modulus or almost complete fluid saturation.},

abstract = {We present spectral element (SE) and discontinuous Galerkin (DG) solutions of the Euler and compressible Navier-Stokes (NS) equations for stratified fluid flow which are of importance in nonhydrostatic mesoscale atmospheric modeling. We study three different forms of the governing equations using seven test cases. Three test cases involve flow over mountains which require the implementation of non-reflecting boundary conditions, while one test requires viscous terms (density current). Including viscous stresses into finite difference, finite element, or spectral element models poses no additional challenges; however, including these terms to either finite volume or discontinuous Galerkin models requires the introduction of additional machinery because these methods were originally designed for first-order operators. We use the local discontinuous Galerkin method to overcome this obstacle. The seven test cases show that all of our models yield good results. The main conclusion is that equation set 1 (non-conservation form) does not perform as well as sets 2 and 3 (conservation forms). For the density current (viscous), the SE and DG models using set 3 (mass and total energy) give less dissipative results than the other equation sets; based on these results we recommend set 3 for the development of future multiscale research codes. In addition, the fact that set 3 conserves both mass and energy up to machine precision motives us to pursue this equation set for the development of future mesoscale models. For the bubble and mountain tests, the DG models performed better. Based on these results and due to its conservation properties we recommend the DG method. In the worst case scenario, the DG models are 50{\%} slower than the non-conservative SE models. In the best case scenario, the DG models are just as efficient as the conservative SE models.},

abstract = {The propagation of acoustic-gravity waves (AGW) from a source on the Earth's surface to the upper atmosphere is investigated with methods of mathematical modeling. The applied non-linear model of wave propagation in the atmosphere is based on numerical integration of a complete set of two-dimensional hydrodynamic equations. The source on the Earth's surface generates waves with frequencies near to the Brunt-Vaisala frequency. The results of simulation have revealed that some region of heating the atmosphere by propagated upward and dissipated AGWs arises above the source at altitudes nearby of 200 km. The horizontal scale of this heated region is about 1000 km in the case of the source that radiates AGWs during approximately 1 h. The appearing of the heated region has changed the conditions of AGW propagation in the atmosphere. When the heated region in the upper atmosphere has been formed, further a waveguide regime of propagation of waves with the periods shorter the Brunt-Vaisala period is realized. The upper boundary of the wave-guide coincides with the arisen heated region in the upper atmosphere. The considered mechanism of formation of large-scale disturbances in the upper atmosphere may be useful for explanation of connections of processes in the upper and lower atmospheric layers.},

At large distances from the epicentre, this event produced coherent infrasonicwaves detected by three infrasound stations that are part of the International Monitoring System. The observed azimuth variations and the long signal durations suggest that wide regions in the Andes Mountains radiated infrasonic waves. From these observations, the main sources' regions are reconstructed. Such an event recorded by multiple stations offers an unique opportunity to evaluate the relative contributions of the different source mechanisms involved in large earthquakes as well as to improve our understanding of the amplification of ground displacement caused by the topography. With a review of infrasound signals from past earthquakes, extended empirical scaling relations are derived. We show that beyond the seismic magnitude, both seismic source and topographic features also play a predominant role in the generation of infrasound.},

However, owing to nonlinear terms in the acoustic source, pairs of ocean surface waves can radiate propagating acoustic waves if the two surface waves propagate in almost equal and opposite directions. We derive an analytic expression for the acoustic radiation by a pair of ocean surface waves, and then extend the result to the case of an arbitrary spectrum of ocean surface waves. We present some examples for both the two-dimensional and three-dimensional regimes. Of particular note are the findings that the efficiency of acoustic radiation increases at higher wavenumbers, and the fact that the directionality of the acoustic radiation is often independent of the shape of the spectrum.},

Moreover, in the linear case, it is shown that if polynomials of degree k are used, the methods are kth order accurate for general triangulations; although this order of convergence is suboptimal, it is sharp for the LDG methods.

abstract = {We measured Vp/Vs ratios of thermally cracked Westerly granite, thermally cracked Carrara marble and 4{\%} porosity Fontainebleau sandstone, for an effective mean pressure ranging from 2 to 95 MPa. Samples were fluid-saturated alternatively with argon gas and water (5 MPa constant pore pressure). The experimental results show that at ultrasonic frequencies, Vp/Vs ratio of water saturated specimen never exceeded 2.15, even at effective mean pressure as low as 2 MPa, or for a lithology for which the Poisson's ratio of minerals is as high as 0.3 (calcite). In order to check these results against theoretical models: we examine first a randomly oriented cracked medium (with dispersion but without anisotropy); and second a medium with horizontally aligned cracks (with anisotropy but without dispersion). The numerical results show that experimental data agree well with the first model: at high frequency, Vp/Vs ratios range from 1.6 to 1.8 in the dry case and from 1.6 to 2.2 in the saturated case. The second model predicts both Vp/Sv and Vp/Sh to vary from 1.2 to 3.5, depending on the raypath angle relative to the crack fabric. In addition, perpendicular to the crack fabric, a high Vp/Vs ratio is predicted in the absence of shear wave splitting. From these results, we argue the possibility that high Vp/Vs ratio ({\textgreater}2.2) as recently imaged by seismic tomography in subduction zones, may come from zones presenting important crack anisotropy. The cumulative effects of crack anisotropy and high pore fluid pressure are required to get Vp/Vs ratios above 2.2. {\textcopyright} 2012. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract = {A generic, non-reflective zonal transverse characteristic boundary condition is described for computational aeroacoustics, which shows superior performance to existing non-reflective boundary conditions for two-dimensional linearized Euler simulations. The new condition is based on a characteristic non-reflective method, and also contains optimised use of transverse characteristic terms and a zonal forcing region. The performance of the new method and several existing non-reflective acoustic boundary conditions is quantitatively compared using a plane wave test case. The performance of buffer zone, perfectly matched layer, far-field, and characteristic non-reflective methods is compared, following an optimisation of the tuneable parameters in each method to give best performance. The study uses a high-order linearised Euler equation solver to assess non-reflective boundary conditions with a variety of cases. The performance is compared for downstream travelling acoustic waves with varying frequency and incident angle, and at various Mach numbers. The current study includes a more comprehensive evaluation than previous studies which used constant values of tuneable parameters or qualitative assessment methods. The new zonal transverse characteristic boundary condition is shown to give improved performance in comparison to the other tested outflow boundary conditions for two-dimensional linearized Euler simulations, and is also shown to give good performance when used as an inflow condition.},

abstract = {We investigate the form and dynamics of shock-acoustic waves generated by earthquakes. We use the method for detecting and locating the sources of ionospheric impulsive disturbances, based on using data from a global network of receivers of the GPS navigation system and requiring no a priori information about the place and time of associated effects. The practical implementation of the method is illustrated by a case study of earthquake effects in Turkey (August 17, and November 12, 1999), in Southern Sumatera (June 4, 2000), and off the coast of Central America (January 13, 2001). It was found that in all instances the time period of the ionospheric response is 180-390 s, and the amplitude exceeds by a factor of two as a minimum the standard deviation of background fluctuations in total electron content in this range of periods under quiet and moderate geomagnetic conditions. The elevation of the wave vector varies through a range of 20-44 degree, and the phase velocity (1100-1300 m/s) approaches the sound velocity at the heights of the ionospheric F-region maximum. The calculated (by neglecting refraction corrections) location of the source roughly corresponds to the earthquake epicenter. Our data are consistent with the present views that shock-acoustic waves are caused by a piston-like movement of the Earth surface in the zone of an earthquake epicenter.},

The analysis leads to conditions on the diffusive flux such that stationary discrete shocks can contain a single interior point. The simplest formulation which meets these conditions is a CUSP scheme in which the coefficients of the pressure differences are fully determined by the coefficient of convective diffusion. It is also shown how both the characteristic and CUSP schemes can be modified to preserve constant stagnation enthalpy in steady flow, leading to four variants, the E and H-characteristic schemes. and the E and H-CUSP schemes. Numerical results are presented which confirm the properties of these schemes.},

abstract = {We present the spectral element method to simulate elastic-wave prop- agation in realistic geological structures involving complicated free-surface topog- raphy and material interfaces for two- and three-dimensional geometries. The spectral element method introduced here is a high-order variational method for the spatial approximation of elastic-wave equations. The mass matrix is diagonal by construc- tion in this method, which drastically reduces the computational cost and allows an efficient parallel implementation. Absorbing boundary conditions are introduced in variational form to simulate unbounded physical domains. The time discretization is based on an energy-momentum conserving scheme that can be put into a classical explicit-implicit predictor/multi-corrector format. Long-term energy conservation and stability properties are illustrated as well as the efficiency of the absorbing con- ditions. The associated Courant condition behaves as At c {\textless} 0 (n{\~{}} lind N-2), with nel the number of elements, na the spatial dimension, and N the polynomial order. In practice, a spatial sampling of approximately 5 points per wavelength is found to be very accurate when working with a polynomial degree of N = 8. The accuracy of the method is shown by comparing the spectral element solution to analytical solu- tions of the classical two-dimensional (2D) problems of Lamb and Garvin. The flex-bility of the method is then illustrated by studying more realistic 2D models in- volving realistic geometries and complex free-boundary conditions. Very accurate modeling of Rayleigh-wave propagation, surface diffraction, and Rayleigh-to-body- wave mode conversion associated with the free-surface curvature are obtained at low computational cost. The method is shown to provide an efficient tool to study the diffraction of elastic waves by three-dimensional (3D) surface topographies and the associated local effects on strong ground motion. Complex amplification patterns, both in space and time, are shown to occur even for a gentle hill topography. Exten- sion to a heterogeneous hill structure is considered. The efficient implementation on parallel distributed memory architectures will allow to perform real-time visualiza- tion and interactive physical investigations of 3D amplification phenomena for seis- mic risk assessment.

abstract = {We present the results of infrasonic interferometry applied to microbaroms, obtained from ambient noise. For this purpose the “Large Aperture Infrasound Array” (LAIA) was used, which has been installed in the Netherlands. Preprocessing appeared to be an essential step in enhancing the microbarom signals from ambient noise that strongly influences the results of the interferometry. Both the state of the atmosphere and the noise characteristics are taken into account to assess the strength of the cross correlation. The delay time of the microbaroms between two stations is determined through cross correlating the recordings. By calculating the cross correlations between all 55 station pairs of LAIA, we are able to find the delay time of microbaroms up to a interstation distance of 40.6 km. Using the strength of the cross correlations, we are able to show that the coherence of the microbaroms along the direction of arrival is higher than orthogonal to it. A comparison of the atmospheric state, with a cross correlation, over a period of 10 days, reveals that the infrasound propagation over the array is correlated with the tropospheric temperature and wind. Based on the cross correlations between the three closest stations, we are able to passively estimate the effective sound speed and the wind speed as a function of time.},

abstract = {We present an introduction to the spectral element method, which provides an innovative numerical approach to the calculation of synthetic seismograms in 3-D earth models. The method combines the {\pounds}exibility of a ¢nite element method with the accuracy of a spectral method. One uses a weak formulation of the equations of motion, which are solved on a mesh of hexahedral elements that is adapted to the free surface and to the main internal discontinuities of the model. The wave¢eld on the elements is discretized using high-degree Lagrange interpolants, and integration over an element is accomplished based upon the Gauss{\^{}}Lobatto{\^{}}Legendre integration rule. This com-bination of discretization and integration results in a diagonal mass matrix, which greatly simpli¢es the algorithm. We illustrate the great potential of the method by comparing it to a discrete wavenumber/re{\pounds}ectivity method for layer-cake models. Both body and surface waves are accurately represented, and the method can handle point force as well as moment tensor sources. For a model with very steep surface topography we successfully benchmark the method against an approximate boundary technique. For a homogeneous medium with strong attenuation we obtain excellent agreement with the analytical solution for a point force.},

The phenomenological theory of linear viscoelasticity provides the basis for describing the attenuation and dispersion of seismic waves. The concept of a spectrum of relaxation mechanisms represents a convenient description of the constitutive relation of linear viscoelastic solids; however, Boltzmann's superposition principle does not have a straightfor-ward implementation in time-domain wave propagation methods. This problem is avoided by the introduction of memory variables which circumvent the convolutional relation between stress and strain. The formulae governing wave propagation are recast as a first-order differential equation in time, in the vector represented by the displacements and memory variables. The problem is solved numerically and tested against. the solution of wave propagation in a homogeneous viscoelastic medium, obtained by using the correspondence principle.},

abstract = {This paper describes new algorithms, not previously available, for predicting atmospheric absorption of sound at high altitudes. A basis for estimating atmospheric absorption up to 160 km is described. The estimated values at altitudes above 90 km must be considered as only approximate due to uncertainties about the composition of the atmosphere above 90 km and simplifying assumptions. At high altitudes, classical and rotational relaxation absorption are dominant, as opposed to absorption by molecular vibrational relaxation that is the principle atmospheric absorption loss mechanism for primary sonic booms propagating downward from a cruising supersonic aircraft. Classical and rotational relaxation absorption varies inversely with atmospheric pressure, thus increasing in magnitude at high altitudes as atmospheric pressure falls. However, classical and rotational losses also relax at the high values of frequency/pressure reached at high altitudes and thus, for audio and infrasonic frequencies, begin to decrease at altitudes in the range of 80–160 km. This paper includes: {\~{}}1! modifications to the existing algorithms in the ISO/ANSI standards for atmospheric absorption at high altitudes, and {\~{}}2! algorithms for definition of mean atmospheric conditions, including humidity content at high altitude conditions. Also included are suitable values for the temperature-dependent physical parameters of the atmosphere, viscosity, and the specific heat ratio, involved in defining atmospheric absorption at temperatures found at high altitudes. It has been found that carbon dioxide plays a major role in the relaxation of O2 and N2 at high altitudes due to the absence of H2O. Molecular relaxation by CO2 , not covered by the current ANSI or ISO standards, is the dominant source of molecular relaxation absorption at altitudes above 60 km at frequencies of 1 Hz and above 10 km at a frequency of 10 kHz. However, at such high altitudes, classical plus rotational losses dominate reaching maximum values at 80–160 km, depending on frequency. In this regime, vibrational relaxation is less important. More accurate predictions of absorption at altitudes above 90 km would require more sophisticated models for the variation in atmospheric viscosity and specific heat ratio above such altitudes.},

abstract = {Wind speeds and directions were measured on the Phoenix Lander by a mechanical anemometer, the so-called Telltale wind indicator. Analysis of images of the instrument taken with the onboard imager allowed for evaluation of wind speeds and directions. Daily characteristics of the wind data are highly turbulent behavior during midday due to daytime turbulence with more stable conditions during nighttime. From Ls ∼77°-123° winds were generally ∼4 m s-1 from the east, with 360° rotation during midday. From Ls ∼123°-148° daytime wind speeds increased to an average of 6-10 m s-1 and were generally from the west. The highest wind speed recorded was 16 m s-1 seen on Ls ∼147°. Estimates of the surface roughness height are calculated from the smearing of the Kapton part of the Telltale during image exposure due to a 3 Hz turbulence and nighttime wind variability. These estimates yield 6 ± 3 mm and 5 ± 3 mm, respectively. The Telltale wind data are used to suggest that Heimdal crater is a source of nighttime temperature fluctuations. Deviations between temperatures measured at various heights are explained as being due to winds passing over the Phoenix Lander. Events concerning sample delivery and frost formation are described and discussed. Two different mechanisms of dust lifting affecting the Phoenix site are proposed based on observations made with Mars Color Imager on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and the Telltale. The first is related to evaporation of the seasonal CO2 ice and is observed up to Ls ∼95°. These events are not associated with increased wind speeds. The second mechanism is observed after Ls ∼111° and is related to the passing of weather systems characterized by condensate clouds in orbital images and higher wind speeds as measured with the Telltale.

abstract = {For considering elastic seismic wave propagation in large domains, efficient absorbing boundary conditions are required with numerical modelling in finite domains. Since their introduction by Berenger, the perfectly matched layers (PML) has become the state-of-the art method because of its efficiency and ease of implementation. However, for anisotropic media, theoretical analysis and numerical experiments show that the PML method is amplifying, that is it exhibits numerical instabilities. Numerical experiments can also exhibit numerical instabilities of the PML when dealing with long time simulations even for isotropic media, especially for finite element methods in unstructured grids. Recently, a new method, called SMART layers approach, has been proposed. This method is shown to be stable even for anisotropic media. The drawback is that the SMART layers are not perfectly matched. We have implemented this new approach in a discontinuous Galerkin method and we illustrate that this method does not exhibit numerical instabilities while PML do for an isotropic elastodynamic simulation. We show that this approach is also competitive with respect to the PML method in terms of efficiency and computational cost.},

abstract = {A simple method is used to quantify the performance of non-reflecting boundary conditions for duct acoustic applications. The method uses a two-dimensional wavesplitting technique to decompose the linearized Euler equations into its constitutive modes, allowing the magnitude of reflected waves from outflow boundaries to be accurately determined. Realistic conditions are simulated by conducting the boundary condition analysis using acoustic waves with characteristics often found in duct and turbomachinery problems. For this paper, the method is used to investigate the performance of three different buffer zone implementations and the Perfectly Matched Layer as non-reflecting boundary conditions. The effect of the damping properties of these boundary conditions and the incident acoustic wave characteristics on performance are considered. Results indicate that the buffer zone boundary condition using explicit damping of the solution vector after each timestep produces the best non-reflecting performance. A deterioration in performance was observed for incident waves at high angles relative to the boundary normal for all implementations. ?? 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We provide a preliminary interpretation of the Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS) pressure data from the first 100 Martian solar days (sols) of the Mars Science Laboratory mission. The pressure sensor is performing well and has revealed the existence of phenomena undetected by previous missions that include possible gravity waves excited by evening downslope flows, relatively dust-free convective vortices analogous in structure to dust devils, and signatures indicative of the circulation induced by Gale Crater and its central mound. Other more familiar phenomena are also present including the thermal tides, generated by daily insolation variations, and the CO2 cycle, driven by the condensation and sublimation of CO2 in the polar regions. The amplitude of the thermal tides is several times larger than those seen by other landers primarily because Curiosity is located where eastward and westward tidal modes constructively interfere and also because the crater circulation amplifies the tides to some extent. During the first 100 sols tidal amplitudes generally decline, which we attribute to the waning influence of the Kelvin wave. Toward the end of the 100 sol period, tidal amplitudes abruptly increased in response to a nearby regional dust storm that did not expand to global scales. Tidal phases changed abruptly during the onset of this storm suggesting a change in the interaction between eastward and westward modes. When compared to Viking Lander 2 data, the REMS daily average pressures show no evidence yet for the 1-20 Pa increase expected from the possible loss of CO 2 from the south polar residual cap.

@article{Pierce1971,
abstract = {Summary A relatively simple theoretical model of near-surface pressure pulse propagation from nuclear explosions is developed from the hypothesis that the early portion of the pulse travels in the real atmosphere's counterpart of Lamb's edge mode. Various concepts of geometrical acoustics are used in the construction of the model. The pulse travels along horizontal ray paths which may be refracted by horizontal variations in the height-averaged effective sound speed and wind velocity. The dispersion of the pulse as it propagates along such paths is governed by a one- dimensional wave equation similar to that derived by Korteweg {\&} de Vries in 1895. Coefficients are found by comparison with the dispersion relation derived by Garrett in 1969 as an expansion in terms of a parameter e describing deviations of the atmospheric profile from isothermal. The method of incorporation of terms governing accumulative far-field non-linear effects is indicated. Height variations in propagating variables are approximated to zeroth order in $\delta$. Variations along horizontal ray paths are governed by the principle of conservation of modal wave action. The excitation of the edge mode is found by matching the general form of the far-field quasi-geometrical solution to the near-field solution for a point energy source in an isothermal atmosphere. Explicit expressions are given for the far-field pressure disturbance. Computations agree favourably with those based on a multimode theory for the first few cycles of the waveform. The edge mode theory leads to a number of implications, which may be compared with existing data. These include the prediction that the energy of the explosion yield may be estimated from a knowledge of the first peak-to-peak period and first peak-to- trough pressure amplitude in far-field records with very little information concerning atmospheric structure, and the prediction that anomalous azimuthal variations in waveform amplitudes may be caused by focusing or defocusing of horizontal ray paths for the edge mode.},

abstract = {In this paper we present numerical techniques suitable for a direct numerical simulation in the spatial setting. We demonstrate the application to the simulation of compressible flat plate flow instabilities. We compare second and fourth order accurate spatial discretization schemes in combination with explicit multistage time stepping for the simulation of the 2D Navier-Stokes equations. We consider Mach numbers 0.5 and 4.5. In the vicinity of the outflow boundary, an efficient buffer domain treatment is introduced, which is suitable in conjunction with an explicit time integration scheme. This treatment requires only a short buffer domain to damp wave reflections at the outflow boundary. Results for the instability of Tollmien-Schlichting (T-S) waves are compared with two instability theories, linear stability theory (LST) and linear parabolized stability equations (PSE). The growth rates of T-S waves for parallel base flow at both Mach numbers compare well with LST results. Moreover, the growth rates of T-S waves for nonparallel base flow compare well with results obtained by solving the PSE at Mach number 0.5. The second order discretization scheme requires, however, considerably higher grid resolution than the fourth order method to achieve accurate results. High amplitude disturbances were also considered to activate nonlinear terms. The nonlinearity strongly affects the form of the T-S waves and the growth rate of the disturbances. The results obtained here support the use of these numerical techniques in flow simulations with increasing complexity such as flat plate flow simulations up to the turbulent regime and with separation regions in 3D. The results also encourage the use of perturbations derived from the compressible PSE as inlet perturbations for nonparallel flow.},

abstract = {14 microbarograph arrays recorded infrasonic signals at distances of between 53 and 930 km from six large chemical explosions detonated at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, US, over an 18 d period during August 2012: the Humming Roadrunner trials. Atmospheric sound speed profiles derived from state-of-the-art meteorological specifications predicted a weak stratospheric duct to stations due west of the six explosions, with effective sound speed ratios between the stratosphere and ground surface of between 0.99 and 1.04. Only thermospheric ducts were predicted along meridional paths. For all explosions, a wider range of signals than predicted by infrasonic propagation modelling is observed. The geographical extent of zonal path observations is significantly greater than predicted, with the first stratospheric return recorded within the modelled shadow zones and out to distances of 900 km. In addition, extended signal coda lasting up to 300 s was recorded, indicative of acoustic multipathing from fine-scale unmodelled atmospheric structure. Along predominantly meridional path arrivals consistent with acoustic refraction in the stratosphere, mesosphere and thermosphere were recorded with celerities between 235 and 295 m s -1 . 24 U-shaped phases were recorded across the six explosions; those with the slowest celerities (220-240 m s -1 ) exhibited periods of up to 16 s, in comparison to phases with stratospheric celerities ({\textgreater}280 m s -1 ) that had periods {\textless}3 s. This is consistent with nonlinear waveform stretching along thermospheric paths. Within the geometric stratospheric shadow zone, at distances of between 53 and 95 km from the source, several tens of seconds of signal coda were recorded, with increasing apparent velocity with time. Preliminary modelling suggests these returns were partially reflected from lower stratospheric ({\textless}35 km) altitudes. The presence of geographically extensive stratospheric zonal returns, meridional stratospheric returns and extended signal coda adds to a growing body of evidence that operational meteorological specifications do not capture the detail required to synthesize regional infrasonic waveforms.},

abstract = {The author presents an alternative to proposed mechanisms explaining horizontal wind gravity wave vertical wavenumber spectra by assuming that the damping effects of molecular viscosity, turbulence, and off-resonance wave-wave interactions can be characterized in terms of a scale-independent diffusivity (D) which increases with altitude. A wave of intrinsic frequency $\omega$ and vertical wave number m is assumed to be completely damped when the effective vertical velocity of momentum diffusion (mD) exceeds the vertical phase velocity of the wave ($\omega$/m). Only waves satisfying mD {\textless} $\omega$/m, or equivalently m2D {\textless} $\omega$ and m {\textless} $\omega$/D)1/2 are permitted to grow in amplitude as they propagate upward in the atmosphere. If the gravity wave temporal spectrum of horizontal winds varies as $\omega$-p, we show that the vertical wave number spectrum must vary as m-2p+1 and the zonal (or meridional) wave number spectrum must vary as k-(2p+1)/3. The spectra are proportioinal to $\omega$-p, m-3 and k-(3p-1)/(p+1). Because the joint (m, $\omega$) intrinsic spectra for both scale-independent and scale-dependent diffusive filtering are not separable, the theory predicts that the m spectra of vertical winds are proportional to m5-2p for scale-independent diffusion and m(7-3p)/(p-1) for scale-dependent diffusion. -from Author},

abstract = {Pressure waves from large nuclear explosions have been recorded at many stations over the earth by instruments installed by the Lamont Geological Observatory. The propagation of these waves is controlled primarily by gravity and the acoustic properties of the atmosphere in a manner that produces group velocity dispersion of the acoustic-gravity modes making up the signal. The nature of the wave dispersion depends on both the thermal and the wind stratification of the atmosphere. The casual relationships have been studied both experimentally and theoretically. To provide more data for air-wave investigations, the 208 Lamont records made at 15 stations from 45 nuclear explosions are presented here together with related data on source, times, and distances.},

@article{Lee2003,
abstract = {The velocity ratio of water-saturated sediment derived from the Biot-Gassmann theory depends mainly on the Biot coefficient—a property of dry rock—for consolidated sediments with porosity less than the critical porosity. With this theory, the shear moduli of dry sediments are the same as the shear moduli of water-saturated sediments. Because the velocity ratio depends on the Biot coefficient explicitly, Biot-Gassmann theory accurately predicts velocity ratios with respect to differential pressure for a given porosity. However, because the velocity ratio is weakly related to porosity, it is not appropriate to investigate the velocity ratio with respect to porosity ($\phi$). A new formulation based on the assumption that the velocity ratio is a function of (1–$\phi$) n yields a velocity ratio that depends on porosity, but not on the Biot coefficient explicitly. Unlike the Biot-Gassmann theory, the shear moduli of watersaturated sediments depend not only on the Biot coefficient but also on the pore fluid. This nonclassical behavior of the shear modulus of water-saturated sediment is speculated to be an effect of interaction between fluid and the solid matrix, resulting in softening or hardening of the rock frame and an effect of velocity dispersion owing to local fluid flow. The exponent n controls the degree of softening/hardening of the formation. Based on laboratory data measured near 1 MHz, this theory is extended to include the effect of differential pressure on the velocity ratio by making n a function of differential pressure and consolidation. However, the velocity dispersion and anisotropy are not included in the formulation.},

@article{Green2009,
abstract = {An earthquake that occurred with a local magnitude of 4.3 and at a depth of 3 km beneath the coastal town of Folkestone, United Kingdom, generated atmos-pheric acoustic waves in the 2-5 Hz bandwidth (infrasound). These were recorded at the FLERS microbarometer array in France at a range of 284 km. Earthquake-generated infrasound is often associated with large earthquakes close to large moun-tain ranges; the shaking of prominent topographic points act as infrasound sources, coupling seismic energy into the atmosphere. In this example there is little prominent topography in the source region apart from the coastal cliffs, which have an average height of 75 m. We explore the possibility that the seismic-to-infrasound coupling occurs at the cliffs by modelling a 23 km length of coast as a series of 305 pistons independently generating acoustic waves. Synthetic seismograms modelling the mo-tion of the cliffs are constrained using recordings from a three-component acceler-ometer located 4 km from the epicenter. Meteorological data, combined with array processing of the microbarometer records, suggest that the acoustic energy propagated to FLERS within the troposphere. The synthetic microbarograms show close agree-ment with the observations; the modelled arrival time is 5 sec earlier than that ob-served, and the peak-to-peak amplitude and signal duration are within a factor of 2 of those recorded. This study shows that moderately sized, shallow seismic disturbances can generate observable infrasound if the topographic conditions close to the epicenter are favorable.},

@article{Mani2012,
abstract = {The aim of this work is to provide practical guidelines for designing sponge layers considering applications in computational fluid dynamics and computational aeroacoustics. We present the analysis of sponge/flow interactions and provide a characterization of its basic reflectivity mechanisms. While sponges are perfect absorbers in one-dimensional systems, they can cause their own reflection when encountering oblique sound or oblique vorticity waves. To minimize this adverse effect, sponge strength and profile need to be selected optimally. Also for a fixed desired accuracy, sponge length should be above a minimum threshold. Our analysis quantifies these requirements for a wide range of conditions in terms of inflow/outflow Mach number, incident frequencies, incident angles, and desired accuracy, and covers main concerns with sponges such as sound/sponge interactions and vortex/sponge interactions. As a test case, we present a nonlinear Euler calculation of a convecting vortex interacting with sponges with different lengths. We show that sponges designed by our guidelines achieve accuracies comparable to perfectly matched layers for the same cost, over moderate to high accuracy demands. The results of the presented analysis can be used to determine sponge requirements for a wide range of CFD applications. A summary of these guidelines are listed in the paper. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {A comparison of the characteristics of auroral infrasonic waves (AIW) in the passband from 10 to 100 sec. period is given for trans-auroral zone stations. The morphology of 2 Hz auroral infrasound observed at Kiruna, Sweden is described. An important asymmetry in the generation of AIW bow waves, with respect to poleward or equatorward motion of auroral electrojet arcs, is shown to be related to the morphology of the ionospheric E-region electric field during an auroral substorm. Auroral radar studies of AIW source arcs are presented. Incoherent scatter radar observations of electron density profiles of auroral arcs are used to describe the differences in arcs that do or do not produce AIW in an attempt to explain the asymmetry in AIW generation by supersonic auroral arcs. An infinite line-current induction model of an auroral electrojet moving transverse to its axis above a conducting earth is used to determine the relationship of an AIW to the surface magnetic perturbation produced by the electrojet. The role of the auroral electrojet in AIW production is discussed in a study of polar magnetic substorms wherein westward traveling auroral surges and the eastern ends of westward auroral electrojets were found to be strong sources of AIW. Theoretical work on the generation of AIW's is reviewed and evaluated with respect to the observed characteristics of AIW substorms. Lorentz force and Joule heat are discussed as probable source terms for the production of the acoustic energy within an auroral electrojet. The important unsolved problems in understanding auroral infrasound are outlined. {\textcopyright} 1975.},

@article{Manning2019,
abstract = {Shallow Radar soundings of the south polar layered deposits (SPLD) have revealed buried CO2 ice with as many as three distinct layers separated by thinner layers of water ice (Bierson et al., 2016). This layering is suggestive of formation by cyclical processes such as obliquity, eccentricity and advance of perihelion. If obliquity is the main driver, then there were many opportunities for CO2 deposits to have formed within the last 3.5-4 Myr. To persist, however, CO2 deposits must be followed by the deposition of an insulating layer of porous water ice that can seal in the CO2 to survive the obliquity maxima that follow. We suggest that the existing deposits were formed within the last 350 kyr. Each obliquity minimum was quickly followed by a period in which perihelion occurred in the northern summer (southern winter) solstice. Under these conditions, an enhanced deposition of low porosity, fine-grained water ice could occur on the winter pole. A similar series of depositions and burials by water ice could have occurred between 2.75 and 2.2 million years ago, but these deposits were unlikely to have survived the many high obliquity swings that occurred between 2.2 Ma and 400 ka. The formation and burial of CO2 ice could also have occurred in similar fashion earlier during the last ∼ 100 Myr in which the southern polar layered deposits were formed. Although at current times the geothermal flux may be too low to cause basal melting of CO2 deposits, in earlier times, deposits formed in deeper scarps and valleys could have led to basal CO2 melting and sequestration into the regolith. By extension, basal melting and sequestration in the regolith may provide an explanation for the fate of the thick CO2 atmosphere (pCO2 ≳ 0.5 bar) implied by climate models of early Mars.},

abstract = {We present a new infrasonic signal detection and back azimuth determination technique that requires just one microphone and one three-component seismometer. Ground-coupled airwaves (GCAs) occur when an incident atmospheric acoustic wave impinges on the ground surface and is partially transmitted as a seismic wave. GCAs are commonly detected hundreds of kilometers away on seismic networks and are observed to have retrograde particle motion. Horizontally propagating acoustic waves and GCAs have previously been observed on collocated infrasound and seismic sensor pairs as coherent with a 90° phase difference. If the sensors are spatially separated, an additional propagation-induced phase shift is present. The additional phase shift depends on the direction from which the acoustic wave arrives, as each back azimuth has a different apparent distance between the sensors. We use the additional phase shift, the coherence, and the characteristic particle motion on the three-component seismometer to determine GCA arrivals and their unique back azimuth. We test this technique with synthetic seismo-acoustic data generated by a coupled Earth-atmosphere 3-D finite difference code, as well as three seismo-acoustic data sets from Mount St. Helens, Mount Cleveland, and Mount Pagan volcanoes. Results from our technique compare favorably with traditional infrasound array processing and provide robust GCA detection and back azimuth determination. Assuming adequate station spacing and sampling, our technique provides a new and robust method to detect infrasonic signals and determine their back azimuth, and may be of practical benefit where resources are limited and large sensor networks or arrays are not feasible.},

Microbarom observations are evaluated to identify detections that cannot be explained by the analysis of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Identified differences can be related to either the altitude limit of the analysis, not resolving thermospheric ducts, or to an actual error in the analysis. Therefore, a first-order model is used to relate observations with the analysis, existing of the Waxler et al. (2007) microbarom source model, including bathymetry to allow column resonances, and an atmospheric propagation model using 3-D ray tracing. Daily normalized spectral powers are proposed to distinguish stratospheric from thermospheric return height, based on the different signature of solar tidal amplitude fluctuations. It is shown that a SSW is not a smooth event as following from the analysis but a series of abrupt changes with a period of 10 to 16 days, increasing in intensity and duration. This is in agreement with the wave period of Rossby waves, interacting with the stratospheric circumpolar vortex. The type of vortex disturbance, split or reversal, can be deduced from the combined effect of the change in back-azimuth direction, solar tidal signature type, and/or phase variation of the amplitude variation of the observed microbaroms.},

abstract = {L.M. Brekhovskikh revealed and studied the important role played by inhomogeneous waves emitted by a point source when they pass through an interface with a medium in which the velocity of sound is lower, for example, from water to air. This paper studies the energy characteristics of sound emitted into air by an underwater point source. The energy transfer due to inhomogeneous waves is shown to cause the phenomenon of anomalous transparency of the interface for low-frequency sound. The anomalous transparency manifests itself in that the energy flux through the interface increases with decreasing frequency of sound and, at sufficiently low frequencies, almost all of the acoustic energy produced by the underwater source is emitted into air. Conversely, at high frequencies, when the contribution of the inhomogeneous waves becomes negligible, the water-to-air interface is similar to a perfectly reflecting surface and almost all of the acoustic energy produced by the source is emitted into water. The anomalous transparency phenomenon changes the conventional opinion on the possibility of acoustic coupling between points in water and air and on the role played by physical processes evolving in the water column in generating atmospheric acoustic noise. {\textcopyright} Nauka/Interperiodica 2007.},

abstract = {A large explosion occurred at the Buncefield Oil Depot, United Kingdom, on the 2005 December 11, as the result of a spillage of 300 tonnes of petrol. The explosion generated large amplitude infrasonic signals that were recorded at ranges of up to 1400 km. We present an analysis of data from across Central Europe using seven infrasound arrays, four of which recorded a total of 20 infrasonic arrivals, and 49 seismometers, which recorded 89 air-to-ground coupled arrivals. Exceptionally high amplitude stratospheric winds occurred at the time of the explosion, propagating east–southeast with speeds of up to 130 m s−1, generating a highly efficient duct for infrasound propagation. The Buncefield explosion can therefore be considered as a benchmark for studying the influence of different propagation algorithms and atmospheric models on phase identification, source location and yield estimation. Significant improvements are made in phase identification using accurate atmospheric parametrizations and 3-D modelling, where we identify 18 of the 20 observed phases, compared to seasonal atmospheric models and 1-D ray tracing which only identify seven of the phases. Additionally, various location scenarios are considered, including cross-bearings and least-squares traveltime and backazimuth inversion, all of which estimate locations within 35 km of ground truth. A novel single array location method using multiple phases works comparably well. Yield estimates made using the stratospheric arrival amplitudes exhibit one order of magnitude variability across the network, with a mean estimate of 51 tonnes high explosive equivalent. Detailed studies, such as this, are important for developing a successful monitoring regime for atmospheric or surface events, and for assessing the capability of the infrasound monitoring component of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty verification system.},

The isothermal theory is refined here to unify the treatment of acoustic, gravity, and evanescent waves in a gravitational atmosphere and to explain the physical processes behind these atmospheric motions. A technique is developed for the solution of the complete hydrodynamic equations that avoids the fatal difficulties normally caused by `Viscous waves' and their thermal counterpart. This technique is used to solve the general problem of gravity wave propagation in a realistic atmosphere for a wide range of wave parameters. The height of maximum wind amplitude and the fraction of reflected energy have been plotted from the results of these calculations. These maxima are also compared with simpler analytic approximations and experimental observations.},

We used direct high-speed video observations of an excised elephant larynx to demonstrate flow-induced self-sustained vocal fold vibration in the absence of any neural signals, thus excluding the need for any "purring" mechanism.

An alternative approach based on spectral transfer functions and the local energy-balance equation of the seismic field is proposed. The method enables a rigorous analysis of the statistical aspects of the problem, which could be treated only approximately and under restrictive conditions in terms of the far-field representations used previously. Three suggested origins of microseisms are considered: (1) the action of ocean waves on coasts, originally proposed by Wiechert; (2) atmospheric pressure fluctuations, as suggested by Gherzi, Scholte, and others; and (3) nonlinear interactions between ocean waves as proposed by Longuet-Higgins. In all cases appreciable microseisms are generated only by Fourier components of the random exciting fields that have the same phase velocities as free modes of the elastic system. The effect of pressure fluctuations associated with turbulence in the atmosphere is found to be negligible. The theory for Wiechert's and Longuet-Higgins' mechanisms is in good agreement with recent measurements by Haubrich et al..},

The array is situated in the classical shadow-zone distance from the explosions. However, strong infrasound is almost always observed, which is most plausibly due to partial reflections from stratospheric altitudes. The most probable propagation paths are subject to both tropospheric and stratospheric cross-winds, and the wave-propagation modelling in this study yields good correspondence between the observed backazimuth deviation and cross-winds from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis (ERA)-Interim reanalysis product.

The Premo code employs a node-centred approach using unstructured meshes, while the Wind code employs a similar scheme on structured meshes. Both codes use Roe's upwind method with MUSCL extrapolation for the convective terms and central differences for the diffusion terms, thus yielding a numerical scheme that is formally second-order accurate. The method of manufactured solutions is employed to generate exact solutions to the governing Euler and Navier-Stokes equations in two dimensions along with additional source terms. These exact solutions are then used to accurately evaluate the discretization error in the numerical solutions. Through global discretization error analyses, the spatial order of accuracy is observed to be second order for both codes, thus giving a high degree of confidence that the two codes are free from coding mistakes in the options exercised. Examples of coding mistakes discovered using the method are also given. {\textcopyright} 2004 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.},

@article{Talmadge2008,
abstract = {A natural terrain surface, because of its porosity, can support an acoustic surface wave that is a mechanical analog of the familiar vertically polarized surface wave in AM radio transmission. At frequencies of several hundred hertz, the acoustic surface wave is attenuated over distances of a few hundred meters. At lower frequencies (e.g., below approximately 200 Hz) the attenuation is much less, allowing surface waves to propagate thousands of meters. At night, a low-frequency surface wave is generally present at long ranges even when downward refraction is weak. Thus, surface waves represent a ubiquitous nighttime transmission mode that exists even when other transmission modes are weak or absent. Data from recent nighttime field experiments and theoretical calculations are presented, demonstrating the persistence of the surface wave under different meteorological conditions. The low-frequency surface wave described here is the "quasiharmonical" tail observed previously in nighttime measurements but not identified by S. Kulichkov and his colleagues (Chunchuzov, I.

Despite the promise of this technique, until recently very few studies had been performed on balloon-borne acoustic sensors.We summarize the history of free flying infrasound stations from the late 1940s to 2014 and report on results from a series of studies spanning 2014–2016. These include the first efforts to record infrasound in the stratosphere in half a century, the presence of a persistent ocean microbarom peak that is not always visible on the ground, and the detection of distant ground explosions. We discuss the unique operational aspects of deploying infrasound sensors on free flying balloons, the types of signals detected at altitude, and the changes to sensor response with height. Finally, we outline the applications of free flying infrasound sensing systems, including treaty verification, bolide detection, upper atmosphere monitoring, and seismoacoustic exploration of the planet Venus.},

abstract = {In support of the InSight mission in which two instruments (the SEIS seismometer and the HP 3 heat flow probe) will interact directly with the regolith on the surface of Mars, a series of mechanical tests were conducted on three different regolith simulants to better understand the observations of the physical and mechanical parameters that will be derived from InSight. The mechanical data obtained were also compared to data on terrestrial sands. The density of the regolith strongly influences its mechanical properties, as determined from the data on terrestrial sands. The elastoplastic compression volume changes were investigated through oedometer tests that also provided estimates of possible changes in density with depth. The results of direct shear tests provided values of friction angles that were compared with that of a terrestrial sand, and an extrapolation to lower density provided a friction angle compatible with that estimated from previous observations on the surface of Mars. The importance of the contracting/dilating shear volume changes of sands on the dynamic penetration of the mole was determined, with penetration facilitated by the ∼1.3Mg/m3 density estimated at the landing site. Seismic velocities, measured by means of piezoelectric bender elements in triaxial specimens submitted to various isotropic confining stresses, show the importance of the confining stress, with lesser influence of density changes under compression. A power law relation of velocity as a function of confining stress with an exponent of 0.3 was identified from the tests, allowing an estimate of the surface seismic velocity of 150 m/s. The effect on the seismic velocity of a 10{\%} proportion of rock in the regolith was also studied. These data will be compared with in situ data measured by InSight after landing. {\textcopyright} 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {The wind velocity structure in the upper stratosphere, mesosphere, and lower thermosphere (MLT) is studied with the recently developed method of infrasound probing of the atmosphere. The method is based on the effect of infrasound scattering from highly anisotropic wind velocity and temperature inhomogeneities in the middle and upper atmosphere. The scattered infrasound field propagates in the acoustic shadow zones, where it is detected by microbarometers. The vertical profiles of the wind velocity fluctuations in the upper stratosphere (30-52km) and MLT (90-140 km) are retrieved from the waveforms and travel times of the infrasound signals generated by explosive sources such as volcanoes and surface explosions. The fine-scale wind-layered structure in these layers was poorly observed until present time by other remote sensing methods, including radars and satellites. It is found that the MLT atmospheric layer (90-102 km) can contain extremely high vertical gradients of the wind velocity, up to 10m/s per 100 m. The effect of a fine-scale wind velocity structure on the waveforms of infrasound signals is studied. The vertical wave number spectra of the retrieved wind velocity fluctuations are obtained for the upper stratosphere. Despite the difference in the locations of the explosive sources all the obtained spectra show the existence of high vertical wave number spectral tail with a -3 power law decay. The obtained spectral characteristics of the wind fluctuations are necessary for improvement of gravity wave drag parameterizations for numerical weather forecast.},

abstract = {A series of ionospheric anomalies following the Sumatra tsunami has been recently reported in the literature. These anomalies show the signature in the ionosphere of tsunami-generated internal gravity waves (IGW) propagating in the neutral atmosphere over the ocean. All these anomalies, observed in the total electron content (TEC) measured by GPS or altimeters, show geographical heterogeneity in the perturbed TEC amplitude and suggest a dependence on geomagnetic latitude. This latitudinal dependence has been taken into account in the previous 3-D modelling used for the interpretation of the TEC Topex and Jason data. Here we present an accurate description of the ocean-atmosphere-ionosphere coupling method, and focus on the properties of the propagation of tsunamigenic IGW in the neutral atmosphere and their interaction with the ionospheric plasma. The analytical dependence on the geomagnetic field in the neutral-plasma coupling discussed in detail and quantitative modelling is used to describe the propagation of a simple tsunami wave at the global scale. What emphasize the role of geomagnetic field within the neutral-plasma coupling at the equatorial and mid-latitude regions. The results, presented here in terms of electron density and TEC variations, show a strong geometric dependance involving the magnetic field inclination and the propagative direction of the tsunami. If the strongest electron density and TEC perturbations are located around -15{\{}degrees{\}}, 0{\{}degrees{\}} and 15{\{}degrees{\}} North, the structure and amplitude of the modelled perturbation changes in the two studied cases--south-north and north-south tsunami propagation.},

Monochromatic forcing near the Earth's surface is used as IGW source in the model. Wave amplitude increases when wave propagates upward due to decreasing atmospheric density. The wave may break at some height. Nonlinear effects (increasing when the wave propagates upward) are examined for different amplitudes of the boundary forcing. At small forcing amplitude, the wave does not break and the main nonlinear effect is a horizontal jet flow created by the wave at high altitudes. At moderate forcing amplitudes, the wave can break mainly due to Kelvin-Helmholtz instability of the wind shears created by propagating wave. Convective instability could be a reason of wave breaking at large forcing amplitudes. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A method of second-order accuracy is described for integrating the equations of ideal compressible flow. The method is based on the integral conservation laws and is dissipative, so that it can be used across shocks. The heart of the method is a one-dimensional Lagrangean scheme that may be regarded as a second-order sequel to Godunov's method. The second-order accuracy is achieved by taking the distributions of the state quantities inside a gas slab to be linear, rather than uniform as in Godunov's method. The Lagrangean results are remapped with least-squares accuracy onto the desired Euler grid in a separate step. Several monotonicity algorithms are applied to ensure positivity, monotonicity and nonlinear stability. Higher dimensions are covered through time splitting. Numerical results for one-dimensional and two-dimensional flows are presented, demonstrating the efficiency of the method.

abstract = {Absorbing boundary conditions for the nonlinear Euler and Navier-Stokes equations in three space dimensions are presented based on the perfectly matched layer (PML) technique. The derivation of equations follows a three-step method recently developed for the PML of linearized Euler equations. To increase the efficiency of the PML, a pseudo mean flow is introduced in the formulation of absorption equations. The proposed PML equations will absorb exponentially the difference between the nonlinear fluctuation and the prescribed pseudo mean flow. With the nonlinearity in flux vectors, the proposed nonlinear absorbing equations are not formally perfectly matched to the governing equations as their linear counter-parts are. However, numerical examples show satisfactory results. Furthermore, the nonlinear PML reduces automatically to the linear PML upon linearization about the pseudo mean flow. The validity and efficiency of proposed equations as absorbing boundary conditions for nonlinear Euler and Navier-Stokes equations are demonstrated by numerical examples. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {According to a paper by Souriau et al., published in 2002, the first bang heard by the population of Toulouse during the blast at the AZF plant, on 21st September 2001 should be the seismo-acoustic wave produced by the AZF explosion, i.e. an indirect wave generated as a transmission wave through the Earth's crust (i.e., a seismic wave) and a refraction wave (i.e., an acoustic wave). We apply the criterion proposed by the authors in favour of a seismo-acoustic wave and show that the latter cannot be validated according to the data corresponding to the first bang. On the other hand, we show that the AZF seismo-acoustic wave has been perceived by only a few witnesses, but as rumblings and not as a bang. Consequently, AZF seismo-acoustic wave and first bang are two phenomena to be clearly discriminated. In particular, the source of the first bang is totally independent of that of the AZF explosion. {\textcopyright} 2009 Acad{\'{e}}mie des sciences.},

The electromagnetic signals detected by all 4 Venera landers are most readily explained as generation by lightning. The Venera 9 spectrometer appears to have observed a lightning storm on one occasion. The Pioneer Venus plasma wave instrument detects waves both below the electron gyrofrequency that may be due to lightning and signals above the electron gyrofrequency but at very low altitudes that may be due to the near field of the lightning. The VLF observations suggest that Venus lightning must be an intra-cloud phenomenon which is most frequent in the afternoon and evening sector.

abstract = {Understanding and speci cation of the higher altitudes of the atmosphere with global coverage over all local times is hampered by the challenges of obtaining direct measurements in the upper atmosphere. Methods to measure the properties of the atmosphere above the stratopause is an active area of scienti c research. In this thesis, we revisit the use of infrasound as a passive remote sensing technique for the upper atmosphere. Signals from the Tungurahua volcano in Ecuador are used to investigate the behavior of the upper atmosphere. Depending on the atmospheric conditions, stratospheric, mesospheric and thermospheric arrivals are observed during intervals of explosive volcanic activity. It is found that the travel times and dominant frequencies of the thermospheric arrivals exhibit a coherent variability with periods equal to those of the tidal harmonics. Theoretical predictions using atmospheric speci cations show that the stratospheric arrivals are predicted within 1{\%} of the observed value. For thermospheric arrivals, this error can be as high as 10{\%}. The error in thermospheric celerities is found to be in accord with the typical uncertainty in upper atmospheric winds. Given the observed response of the infrasound celerities to upper atmospheric tidal variability, it is suggested that infrasound observations may be used as an additional source of information to constrain the atmospheric speci cations in the upper atmosphere. We present corrected wind pro les that have been obtained by minimizing mis ts in traveltime and source location using a Bayesian statistics grid search algorithm. Also, a Levenberg- Marquardt search algorithm is developed. Additionally, a new numerical method has been developed to solve the problem of infrasound propagation in a strati ed medium with (high Mach number) background flow, based on a modal expansion. The underlying mathematics is by no means new and has been earlier described, such as in Pierce (1963). This solution goes beyond the e ective sound speed approximation, which is typically used in infrasound propagation modeling for computational efficiency reasons. Using the wide angle high Mach number modal solution, it is shown that traveltimes and shadow zones are underpredicted using the effective sound speed approximation, with increasing grazing angle and Mach number.},

abstract = {The propagation of sound in a stratified downward-refracting atmosphere over a complex impedance plane is studied. The problem is solved by separating the wave equation into vertical and horizontal parts. The vertical part has non-self-adjoint boundary conditions, so that the well-known expansion in orthonormal eigenfunctions cannot be used. Instead, a less widely known eigenfunction expansion for non-self-adjoint ordinary differential operators is employed. As in the self-adjoint case, this expansion separates the acoustic field into a ducted part, expressed as a sum over modes which decrease exponentially with height, and an upwardly propagating part, expressed as an integral over modes which are asymptotically (with height) plane waves. The eigenvalues associated with the modes in this eigenfunction expansion are, in general, complex valued. A technique is introduced which expresses the non-self-adjoint problem as a perturbation of a self-adjoint one, allowing one to efficiently find the complex eigenvalues without having to resort to searches in the complex plane. Finally, an application is made to a model for the nighttime boundary layer.},

In the spectral element discretization, the computational domain is broken into a series of elements, and the velocity in each element is represented as a high-order Lagrangian interpolant through Chebyshev collocation points. The hyperbolic piece of the governing equations is then treated with an explicit collocation scheme, while the pressure and viscous contributions are treated implicitly with a projection operator derived from a variational principle. The implementation of the technique is demonstrated on a one-dimensional inflow-outflow advection-diffusion equation, and the method is then applied to laminar two-dimensional (separated) flow in a channel expansion.

abstract = {Dominant surface waves on the ocean exhibit a dispersion relation that confines their energy to a curve in a wavenumber-frequency spectrum. Short wind waves on the ocean, on the other hand, are advected by these dominant waves so that they do not exhibit a well-defined dispersion relation over many realizations of the surface. Here we show that the short-wave analog to the dispersion relation is a distributed spectrum in the wavenumber-frequency plane that collapses to the standard dispersion relation in the absence of long waves. We compute probability distributions of short-wave wavenumber given a (frequency, direction) pair and of short-wave frequency given a (wavenumber, direction) pair. These two probability distributions must yield a single spectrum of surface displacements as a function of wavenumber and frequency, F(k,f). We show that the folded, azimuthally averaged version of this spectrum has a "butterfly" pattern in the wavenumber-frequency plane if significant long waves are present. Integration of this spectrum over frequency yields the well-known k-3 wavenumber spectrum. When integrated over wavenumber, the spectrum yields an f-4 form that agrees with measurement. We also show that a cut through the unfolded F(k,f) at constant k produces the well-known form of moderate-incidence-angle Doppler spectra for electromagnetic scattering from the sea. This development points out the dependence of the short-wave spectrum on the amplitude of the long waves.},

abstract = {The 2011 Mw9.0 Tohoku earthquake generated infrasound that was recorded by nine infrasonic arrays. Most arrays recorded a back azimuth variation with time due to the expanse of the source region. We use ray tracing to predict group velocities and back azimuth wind corrections. A Japan accelerometer network recorded ground shaking in unprecedented spatial resolution. We back projected infrasound from arrays IS44 (Kamchatka) and IS30 (Tokyo) to the source region and compare these results with acceleration data. IS44 illuminates the complex geometry of land areas that experienced shaking. IS30 illuminates two volcanoes and a flat area around the city of Sendai, where the maximum accelerations occurred. The arrays and epicentral region define three source-receiver profiles. The observed broadband energy transmission loss (TL) follows an exponential decay law. The best fitting model, which has parameters that are interpreted to include the effects of geometric spreading, scattering, and the maximum ratio of the effective sound speed in the stratosphere to that at the ground (accounts for stratospheric wind speed), yields a 65{\%} variance reduction relative to predictions from a traditional TL relationship. This model is a simplified version of the model of Le Pichon et al. (2012), which yields an 83{\%} variance reduction for a single frequency, implying that fine-scale atmospheric structure is required to explain the TL for stratospheric upwind propagation. Our results show that infrasonic arrays are sensitive to ground acceleration in the source region of megathrust earthquakes. The TL results may improve infrasonic amplitude scaling laws for explosive yield.

abstract = {Summary The displacement response of an elastic half space to a plane pressure wave is examined in order to establish the conditions under which sources of this type can contribute significantly to the long-period seismic noise field. The study is restricted to pressure waves which propagate at velocities well below the seismic wave velocities characteristic of the half space. The numerical studies indicate that pressure waves with amplitudes of 100 $\mu$bar or more can contribute significantly to the long-period vertical background noise observed at the surface, provided that the detectors are located on sections of alluvial fill or poorly to moderately indurated sandstones and shales whose thicknesses are greater than about a kilometre. These same waves can also create significant tilt noise on long-period horizontal seismographs located at or near the surface, regardless of the rock type. The seismic disturbances created by pressure waves decay rapidly away from the surface. Therefore, it appears that it may be possible to eliminate the effects of atmospherically generated noise by placing the detectors at moderate depths.},

A conceptual model is proposed to correlate deformation and damage fields (including acoustic emission activity) with the variation of ultrasonic velocities, quality factors and energies as measures of attenuation. This correlation is presented in a stress deviator versus confining pressure diagram. In this way, the successive steps occurring in the damage process of this rock are well described. In particular, the quality factor of S-waves distinguishes clearly the onset of the initially stable cracking, while the velocity of S-waves and strain measurements are sensitive to dilatancy which appears later in the damage process of the limestone studied.},

abstract = {A large data set consisting of about 1000 normal mode periods, 500 summary travel time observations, 100 normal mode Q values, mass and moment of inertia have been inverted to obtain the radial distribution of elastic properties, Q values and density in the Earth's interior. The data set was supplemented with a special study of 12 years of ISC phase data which yielded an additional 1.75 × 106 travel time observations for P and S waves. In order to obtain satisfactory agreement with the entire data set we were required to take into account anelastic dispersion. The introduction of transverse isotropy into the outer 220 km of the mantle was required in order to satisfy the shorter period fundamental toroidal and spheroidal modes. This anisotropy also improved the fit of the larger data set. The horizontal and vertical velocities in the upper mantle differ by 2-4{\%}, both for P and S waves. The mantle below 220 km is not required to be anisotropic. Mantle Rayleigh waves are surprisingly sensitive to compressional velocity in the upper mantle. High Sn velocities, low Pn velocities and a pronounced low-velocity zone are features of most global inversion models that are suppressed when anisotropy is allowed for in the inversion. The Preliminary Reference Earth Model, PREM, and auxiliary tables showing fits to the data are presented. {\textcopyright} 1981.},

This method involved the recursive evaluation of a discrete convolution, and was therefore relatively efficient. In this work, the recursive convolution approach is extended to media with dispersions described by multiple second-order poles. The significant change from the first-order implementation is that the single backstore variable for each second-order pole is complex. The approach is demonstrated for a pulsed plane wave incident on a medium with a complex permittivity described by two second-order poles, and excellent agreement is obtained with the exact solution},

Detailed results are presented for the case of the Concorde SST in straight, level, and steady flight at 17.5 km and a velocity of Mach 2. We predict maximum ground level pressures of 0.3 Pa with an N-wave ''period'' of about 10 s. The sound level is a minimum along the flight track with the maximum signal strength occurring about 300 km off the flight track. The strongest received signal travels initially downward and reflects off the surface of the ocean to the thermosphere. The wave turns around at an altitude of 160 km and is returned back to the ground at a horizontal distance of 320 km from the launch point.},

The second part is devoted to numerical experiments and to numerical comparisons with the previously used techniques of free-space simulation.

abstract = {We present a spectral element approach for modeling elastic wave propagation in a solid-fluid sphere where the local effects of gravity are taken into account. The equations are discretized in terms of the displacement in the solid and the velocity potential in a neutrally stratified fluid. The spatial approximation is based upon a spherical mesh of hexahedra in which local refinement allows for adapting the discretization to the variation of elastic parameters in both the solid and the fluid regions. Continuity constraints across the non-conforming interfaces are introduced through Lagrange multipliers which are further discretized by the mortar element method. Due to the spherical nature of the non-conforming interfaces the mortar method turns out to be functionally conforming and allows for an equal-order interpolation of the primal variables and the Lagrange multipliers. The method is shown to provide an accurate solution when compared to analytical calculations obtained for radial models of elastic parameters. Its parallel implementation is based upon a simple domain decomposition strategy which makes it efficient to solve large problems as those imposed by planetary scales. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {The recent tsunamigenic earthquake in Tohoku (11 March 2011) strongly affirms, one more time after the Sumatra event (26 December 2004), the necessity to open new paradigms in oceanic monitoring. Detection of ionospheric anomalies following the Sumatra tsunami demonstrated that ionosphere is sensitive to the tsunami propagation. Observations supported by modeling proved that tsunamigenic ionospheric anomalies are deterministic and reproducible by numerical modeling via the ocean/neutral-atmosphere/ionosphere coupling mechanism. In essence, tsunami induces internal gravity waves propagating within the neutral atmosphere and detectable in the ionosphere. Most of the ionospheric anomalies produced by tsunamis were observed in the far field where the tsunami signature in the ionosphere is clearly identifiable. In this work, we highlight the early signature in the ionosphere produced by tsunamigenic earthquakes and observed by GPS, measuring the total electron content, close to the epicenter. We focus on the first hour after the seismic rupture. We demonstrate that acoustic-gravity waves generated at the epicenter by the direct vertical displacement of the source rupture and the gravity wave coupled with the tsunami can be discriminated with theoretical support. We illustrate the systematic nature of those perturbations showing several observations: nominally the ionospheric perturbation following the tsunamigenic earthquakes in Sumatra on 26 December 2004 and 12 September 2007; in Chile on 14 November 2007; in Samoa on 29 September 2009; and the recent catastrophic Tohoku-Oki event on 11 March 2011. Based on the analytical description, we provide tracks for further modeling efforts and clues for the interpretation of complex—and thus often misleading—observations. The routine detection of the early ionospheric anomalies following the rupture highlights the role of ionospheric sounding in the future ocean monitoring and tsunami detection.},

abstract = {The invariant parameter called beta is often useful for describing the acoustic interference pattern in a waveguide. For some shallow water waveguides, the measured acoustic intensity might contain contributions from several propagating acoustic modes. For each pair of these modes, a different value for the waveguide invariant might apply. If the acoustic intensity is measured over some distributed aperture and finite bandwidth, it may become difficult to assign a single value to beta. In the present work, the waveguide invariant is treated as a distribution. An algorithm for estimating this distribution for a general measurement geometry is developed. The algorithm is exercised for different classes of shallow water waveguides. When the propagation is dominated by modes interacting with the sea surface, the distribution can be sharply peaked. For cases where the sound speed profile creates a duct, the distribution is more diffuse. The effects of source/receiver depth, range, bandwidth and bottom attenuation are quantified.},

abstract = {A multilayer Fourier method is developed for modeling gravity waves above some altitude at which the vertical velocity is given as a boundary condition. The method is described in a general context in which the altitude and time variation of Fourier components for fixed horizontal wavenumbers is specified by a linear homogeneous partial differential equation (PDE) of any order, with coefficients varying with altitude. The coefficients are required to meet certain conditions so that causality is preserved and upgoing and downgoing modes can be defined. It is shown that causality is not preserved unless dissipative modes are included. An imaginary frequency shifting technique is introduced to allow upgoing and downgoing modes to be defined in certain situations that would otherwise be problematic. The pervasive problem of numerical swamping, endemic to multilayer approaches to viscous and thermally diffusive gravity-wave problems, is solved using a scattering matrix method, related to a method from seismology, which differs fundamentally from earlier gravity-wave solution methods cited herein. The method is applied to gravity waves in the linear, nonhydrostatic, anelastic, viscous, and thermally diffusive case with vertically varying background winds, in addition to certain limiting cases. The PDE in altitude and time is obtained from a dispersion relation that includes odd powers of the vertical wavenumber, making necessary the aforementioned imaginary frequency shifting technique.},

The CEA/DASE has in charge the installation and maintenance of a number of these stations as well as the development of data processing methods for operational infrasound monitoring. Due to the lack of data in the middle and upper atmosphere ($\backslash${\textgreater}50 km), there is a growing interest in infrasound measurements as a remote sensing technology for atmospheric sounding. Various simulation studies show the relevance of infrasound data for validating standard atmospheric models, and most of them point the limits of these models to explain the large variability observed in infrasound data. Systematic biases are observed between simulations and observations, especially during the seasonal transitions and at smaller time scale (days), due to meteorological effects. They are the manifestations of atmospheric variations not included in the models. Our studies deal with the development of inversion methods of infrasound data in order to retrieve some meteorological parameters of the atmosphere such as wind velocity or temperature profiles. We present a methodology for infrasound data inversion, regularization methods of the inverse problem and preliminary results from synthetic data.},

In this paper, absorbing boundary conditions based on the Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) technique are presented for nonlinear Euler equations in primitive variables. A pseudo mean flow is introduced in the derivation of the PML equations for increased efficiency. Absorbing equations are presented in unsplit physical primitive variables in both the Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates. Numerical examples show the effectiveness of the proposed equations although they are not theoretically perfectly matched to the nonlinear Euler equations. The derived equations are tested in numerical examples and compared with the PML absorbing boundary condition in conservation form that was formulated in an earlier work. The performance of the PML in primitive variables is found to be close to that of the conservation formulation. A comparison with the linear PML in nonlinear problems is also considered. It is found that using nonlinear absorbing equations presented in this paper significantly improves the performance of the absorbing boundary condition for strong nonlinear cases. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A crucial issue in fluid dynamics is related to the knowledge of the fluid pressure. A new general pressure equation is derived from compressible Navier–Stokes equation. This new pressure equation is valid for all real dense fluids for which the pressure tensor is isotropic. It is argued that this new pressure equation allows unifying compressible, low-Mach and incompressible approaches. Moreover, this equation should be able to replace the Poisson equation in isothermal incompressible fluids. For computational fluid dynamics, it can be seen as an alternative to Lattice Boltzmann methods and as the physical justification of artificial compressibility.},

abstract = {Computational models are used to gain insight about the phenomena associated with airbursts caused by the hypervelocity entry, ablation, breakup, and explosion of asteroids and comets in planetary atmospheres. Among the resulting discoveries has been the recognition that airbursts caused by downwardly directed collisions do more damage at the surface than a nuclear explosion of the same yield. They are therefore more dangerous than previously thought. At Sandia National Laboratories, the multidimensional, multi-material shock-physics code, CTH, has been run on high-performance computers using adaptive mesh refinement to resolve phenomena across spatial scales over many orders of magnitude. These simulations have led to the discovery of unexpected phenomena that emerge from the highly directed geometry of these events, such as ballistic plumes that rise to low Earth orbital altitudes before collapsing, ring vortices that descend to the surface and add to the list of damage mechanisms, and the splitting of shallow entry wakes into linear vortices that become visible as twin condensation trails. As scientific understanding has improved, these models are ready to be focused on systematic, high-fidelity, multiscale, multi-physics-based quantitative risk assessments to objectively inform policy decisions associated with planetary defense.},

abstract = {In-situ extra-terrestrial seismic measurements have, to date, been limited to data collected during the lunar Apollo missions. These data have provided significant contributions to our understanding of the interior structure of the Moon, and by inference, permissible thermal and mineralogical models. In addition, the seismic activity recorded by the Apollo stations provides information on both internal (moonquakes) and external (meteoroid) sources. The seismic activity of other bodies, notably Mars and Venus, has never been measured. It can however be estimated, subject to approximations regarding the thermal structure of the lithospheres of these bodies, strain rates, and plausible present-day tectonic activity. For both Mars and Venus, events detectable by surface seismometers are likely: Martian estimates are 50(10) quakes annually with moment magnitude Mw greater than 3.8(4.5). In addition, impacts large enough for seismology may occur at a rate comparable to the Moon. Venusian estimates are 100(25) quakes annually with Mw greater than 5(6). Such seismic activities, much larger than the lunar ones, justify the deployment of seismic monitoring systems on these planets. In the foreseeable future, Mars is the new body most likely to be explored through surface landers: current understanding of the interior structure, seismic noise levels and scattering on this body indicate that body wave and regional surface wave investigations could yield enormous insight into the structure and evolution of this planet. Other targets, like asteroids, Europa will also benefit similarly from passive seismic experiments, as well as a return to the Moon with more sensitive seismometers. The deployment of surface landers might be much more difficult on Venus, due to the high surface temperature. Acoustic coupling of a planet's atmosphere with its internal body provides however opportunities for seismic investigations, and can be used either on Venus, a planet with a dense atmosphere, or on Giant planets. On Venus, signals at a given height in the atmosphere for a given quake magnitude can have amplitudes 600x their terrestrial counterparts for a given quake seismic moment. The possibility of detection of Venusian quakes from orbit exists through a combination of the near-source thermal and albedo signatures and ionospheric perturbations associated to Rayleigh waves. Detection of atmospheric normal modes of the giant planets can on the other hand be forseen with ground or space-based techniques and may provides opportunities for future exploration of the interiors of these bodies},

abstract = {A maximum likelihood (ML) acoustic source location estimation method is presented for the application in a wireless ad hoc sensor network. This method uses acoustic signal energy measurements taken at individual sensors of an ad hoc wireless sensor network to estimate the locations of multiple acoustic sources. Compared to the existing acoustic energy based source localization methods, this proposed ML method delivers more accurate results and offers the enhanced capability of multiple source localization. A multiresolution search algorithm and an expectation-maximization (EM) like iterative algorithm are proposed to expedite the computation of source locations. The Crame´r-Rao Bound (CRB) of the ML source location estimate has been derived. The CRB is used to analyze the impacts of sensor placement to the accuracy of location estimates for single target scenario. Extensive simulations have been conducted. It is observed that the proposed ML method consistently outperforms existing acoustic energy based source localization methods. An example applying this method to track military vehicles using real world experiment data also demonstrates the performance advantage of this proposed method over a previously proposed acoustic energy source localization method.},

abstract = {We provide here a preliminary analysis of the ionospheric perturbations observed after the 11 March 2011 Tohoku earthquake using a GPS-derived Total Electron Content (TEC) technique. Such anomalies are routinely observed after seismic events of magnitude Mw=6 and more. Here, we use the high density and the wide coverage of the Japanese Global Positioning System (GPS) network GEONET to image the ionosphere just after the main shock. We describe ionospheric perturbations with exceptional extension in amplitude and duration. As already seen in earlier events, a first intense signal is observed about 10 minutes after the seismic rupture; the first response consists in two modes: one propagating beyond 3 km/s and the other at nearly 1 km/s. A further analysis of TEC time series of the latter mode near the source shows the typical frequencies of acoustic resonance. Beyond 400 km from the source, both the tsunami induced gravity wave and a third mode are imaged, the latter for the first time. We show that the pattern of this slow (225 m/s $\backslash$pm 10 m/s) and long period gravity wave (1.8 $\backslash$pm 0.2 mHz) is most visible in the North-West of the epicentral area. This description is corroborated by a computation of the normal modes of the solid Earth-atmosphere system.},

abstract = {The Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) is a fully discrete mesoscopic method capable of simulating incompressible fluid flow. The method was discovered in 1988, further developed in the first half of the 1990's and reached full maturity in the last decade. The original LBM was extended in many ways, in the direction of multiphase flows, thermal flows, suspension flows, and to include turbulence, chemical reactions and solute transport. The basic theory of LBM for single-phase flow is well established, although even today research papers are being published that address subtle issues in the theory. Moreover, understanding of the embedding of the LBM in the broader context of the continuous Boltzmann equation, the macroscopic Navier Stokes equations, and microscopic theories is by now well understood. In this document the Lattice Boltzmann Method will first be introduced, followed by a theoretical demonstration that the model indeed mimics incompressible hydrodynamics. Next, the embedding of the method in both microscopic – and macroscopic theories will be clarified.},

@article{Madeleine2011,
abstract = {Airborne dust is the main driver of Martian atmospheric temperature, and accurately accounting for its radiative effect in Global Climate Models (GCMs) is essential. This requires the modeling of the dust distribution and radiative properties, and when trying to simulate the true climate variability, the use of the observed dust column opacity to guide the model. A recurrent problem has been the inability of Mars GCMs to predict realistic temperatures while using both the observed dust radiative properties and column opacity. One would have to drive the model with a tuned opacity to reach an agreement with the observations, thereby losing its self-consistency. In this paper, we show that using the most recently derived dust radiative properties in the LMD (Laboratoire de M{\'{e}}t{\'{e}}orologie Dynamique) GCM solves this problem, which was mainly due to the underestimation of the dust single scattering albedo in the solar domain. However, an overall warm temperature bias remains above the 1 hPa pressure level. We therefore refine the model by implementing a "semi-interactive" dust transport scheme which is coupled to the radiative transfer calculations. This scheme allows a better representation of the dust layer depth in the model and thereby removes the remaining warm bias. The LMD/GCM is now able to predict accurate temperatures without any tuning of the dust opacity used to guide the model. Remaining discrepancies are discussed, and seem to be primarily due to the neglect of the radiative effect of water-ice clouds, and secondarily to persisting uncertainties in the dust spatial distribution.

abstract = {Standard meteorological balloons can deliver small scientific payloads to the stratosphere for a few tens of minutes, but achieving multihour level flight in this region is more difficult. We have developed a solar-powered hot-air balloon named the heliotrope that can maintain a nearly constant altitude in the upper troposphere–lower stratosphere as long as the sun is above the horizon. It can accommodate scientific payloads ranging from hundreds of grams to several kilograms. The balloon can achieve float altitudes exceeding 24 km and fly for days in the Arctic summer, although sunset provides a convenient flight termination mechanism at lower latitudes. Two people can build an envelope in about 3.5 h, and the materials cost about {\$}30. The low cost and simplicity of the heliotrope enables a class of missions that is generally out of reach of institutions lacking specialized balloon expertise. Here, we discuss the design history, construction techniques, trajectory characteristics, and flight prediction of the heliotrope balloon. We conclude with a discussion of the physics of solar hot-air balloon flight.},
