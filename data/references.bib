  abstract = {{\textcopyright}2018. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. The mechanical coupling between solid planets and their atmospheres enables seismically induced acoustic waves to propagate in the atmosphere. We numerically simulate this coupled system for two application cases: active seismic experiments (ASEs) and passive seismic experiments. A recent ASE (Krishnamoorthy et al., 2018, https://doi.org/10.1002/2018GL077481) observed the infrasonic signals produced by a seismic hammer. To measure the sensitivity of observations to seismic parameters, we attempt to reproduce the results from this experiment at short range by considering a realistic unconsolidated subsurface and an idealized rock-solid subsurface. At long range, we investigate the influence of the source by using two focal mechanisms. We found surface waves generate an infrasonic plane head wave in the ASE case of the rock-solid material. For the passive seismic experiments, the amplitude of atmospheric infrasound generated by seismic surface waves is investigated in detail. Despite some limitations, the simulations suggest that balloon measurement of seismically induced infrasound might help to constrain ground properties.},

@article{Spiga2018a,
  abstract = {In November 2018, for the first time a dedicated geophysical station, the InSight lander, will be deployed on the surface of Mars. Along with the two main geophysical packages, the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS) and the Heat-Flow and Physical Properties Package (HP3), the InSight lander holds a highly sensitive pressure sensor (PS) and the Temperature and Winds for InSight (TWINS) instrument, both of which (along with the InSight FluxGate (IFG) Magnetometer) form the Auxiliary Sensor Payload Suite (APSS). Associated with the RADiometer (RAD) instrument which will measure the sur- face brightness temperature, and the Instrument Deployment Camera (IDC) which will be used to quantify atmospheric opacity, this will make InSight capable to act as a meteoro- logical station at the surface of Mars. While probing the internal structure of Mars is the primary scientific goal of the mission, atmospheric science remains a key science objective for InSight. InSight has the potential to provide a more continuous and higher-frequency record of pressure, air temperature and winds at the surface of Mars than previous in situ missions. In the paper, key results from multiscale meteorological modeling, from Global Climate Models to Large-Eddy Simulations, are described as a reference for future stud- ies based on the InSight measurements during operations. We summarize the capabilities of InSight for atmospheric observations, from profiling during Entry, Descent and Landing to surface measurements (pressure, temperature, winds, angular momentum), and the plans for how InSight's sensors will be used during operations, as well as possible synergies with orbital observations. In a dedicated section, we describe the seismic impact of atmospheric phenomena (from the point of view of both “noise” to be decorrelated from the seismic signal and “signal” to provide information on atmospheric processes). We discuss in this framework Planetary Boundary Layer turbulence, with a focus on convective vortices and dust devils, gravity waves (with idealized modeling), and large-scale circulations. Our paper also presents possible new, exploratory, studies with the InSight instrumentation: surface layer scaling and exploration of the Monin-Obukhov model, aeolian surface changes and saltation / lifing studies, and monitoring of secular pressure changes. The InSight mission will be instrumental in broadening the knowledge of the Martian atmosphere, with a unique set of measurements from the surface of Mars.},

  abstract = {The Graetz problem is a convection-diffusion equation in a pipe invariant along a direction. The contribution of the present work is to propose a mathematical analysis of the Neumann, Robin and periodic boundary condition on the boundary of a semi-infinite pipe. The solution in the 3D space of the original problem is reduced to eigenproblems in the 2D section of the pipe. The set of solutions is described, its structure depends on the type of boundary condition and of the sign of the total flow of the fluid. This analysis is the cornerstone of numerical methods to solve Graetz problem in finite pipes, semi infinite pipes and exchangers of arbitrary cross section. Numerical test-cases illustrate the capabilities of these methods to provide solutions in various configurations.},
